"No almond butter does NOT taste like PB"
"it is too nutty"
"No jif style creamy peanut butter is a MUCH better texture than almond butter "
"But I'm willing to be flexible and get almond butter if it means we get almond milk"
"Almond milk is so delicious and it doesn't go bad easily and has no dairy!!!!"

"People are so fucked up"
"The noose is horrifying and so so so messed up "
"Is anyone else just shocked..."
"It absolutely is though... What else does a noose represent? It's not like handcuffs or something that just represent ""repression"" or is subtle. A noose is clearly associated with race and terror and violence. People in this world are horrible and I have no faith in humanity "
"It's awful because the civil rights movement is so clearly not even close to ""over"""
"Even if it's a joke though, regardless of the intentions whether they were to be funny or to be blatantly and outwardly racist and terrorizing, the actions had a certain effect & they are absolute idiots if they didn't think about that "
"So regardless of if it was intentional or ignorant, the action demonstrates something wrong with society- that that thought would cross someone's mind as something potentially funny "
"check your email, should be an email from lmo"
http://www.dukechronicle.com/articles/2015/04/01/noose-reported-bryan-center-plaza#.VRvw4ZPF_lQ
"Does no one else have an opinion...?"
"Some response or solidarity would be nice though- thank you for the response team"
"Just because we all agree doesn't mean we shouldn't share in being upset or disappointed (like friends are supposed to do). It's important to talk about things like this because it brings it into our consciousness and awareness, and allows us to engage with our thoughts and opinions with other people, rather than simply ignoring it or taking it for what it is"
"I'm sorry if it came off like I'm condescendingly asking you guys to respond- I'm just really upset about this and would like to know my friends agree with me and support that this needs to change. I also do think even if we're all on the same page, that conversations aren't useless, that by talking about it, we can try to better understand not just this event but societal racism and think about why it still exists in such a blatant form, and maybe arrive at what we as individuals can do to try to address it or at least talk about it in a way that maybe could lead to conversations with other people that might eventually impact and change even just one or two people's minds"
"I've never been so disillusioned with humanity- we had a really disheartening class on dealing with hunger yesterday at the expense of the environment and the future ability to provide food. If something so blatantly rude and so obviously bad happens, how can we get these people to care enough to make changes for the good of everyone? I just feel so hopeless that we can make positive change with so much hate in the world"
"But the problem is when those are the people with power! Like politicians for example. Then their opinions and actions influence so so many people and like we are so small trying to fight all this horribleness in the world"
"I agree with Natalie. That it occurs in just the duke community, a place that feels small & that we know actions will directly influence people right around us, demonstrates hate towards some in your direct community. How then can we address those who's actions influence the entire world, people they've never met who they will never have to meet who are suffering the negative consequences of their actions?"
"No but I think as long as that .001% exists, there is something to still be changed. Society's ""norm"" is always changing. 60 years ago having a black president would have seemed so ""extreme"", and now we have a new ""extreme"""
"Davis, that's a good point, but it's just hard to like every single day be dealing with so much hate and just keep being hopeful you know? Because change comes in such tiny tiny increments and there's always so much opposition, it's easy to get knocked down "
"I agree Nat, it seems like individual acts of hatred are so much more paid attention to or negatively influential than individual acts of love can do to reverse that"

Woohoo!
"We shouldn't let big companies like syngenta put patents on their specific GMO seeds & make it illegal to re-use seeds. I think it'd be hard to regulate what modifications are ok, but generally I've come to support GMOs that can help feed people for nutrition (like golden rice for example) but not as much Round Up Ready which has to do with essentially building some pesticides into the plant or just dumb ones like making something neon for the sake of doing so"
"Just got wifi but I agree with A about vegetarianism! And for health benefits which Nat mentioned, i originally went pescetarian to avoid ingesting all the antibiotics they pre emptively use in animals! So that might be something that's not as big a problem for Ben and jerrys but could apply for meat"
"Lol jicama"
"No I appreciate that u are asking Bri!!!"
"So antibiotics usually are used if the animals develop a disease, like say their bones are too weak or they get some sort of growth abnormality or infection. But the way that animals are treated (like chickens in small enclosed spaces all on top of each other) means that it's expected & not rare that they get these diseases. So often when the animals are born, they're immediately injected with these antibiotics (because the farmers know they will eventually be needed to treat the inevitable diseases)"
"My big problem is one, that the meat industry has come to a point where that's the norm. And two, that by eating these animals, we are gaining antibiotic resistance to these antibiotics"
"And to the question about are they just in meat- I think they're in fish too if those fish are farmed. And of course with fruits and veggies we deal with pesticide and other issues. So it's hard cuz really anything you eat is ""bad"" in some way"
"And I actually don't know how similar the antibiotics are- would be interesting to learn more. But for example, everyone also gets mad about them injecting growth hormones (rbgh I thiiink is what it's called) because it can potentially affect how we grow "
"So I actually went thru a phase where I truly considered working for an artificial meat startup"

When we're at school i will totally want to hang out with him & try to get to know him well one on one if you guys really want him to be our friend, but that's not possible during the summer to get to know him better or what not"

"Can agree with that sentiment- if it's an educational game that is actually historically accurate then it's ok. But I am confused about why there need to be games about the civil war? Unless they're just re-enactments and what happens is just showing you what actually happened (but then I feel like that defeats the purpose of a game?)"
"Well I feel like iPhones help you communicate and express your own life! But civil war games just confuse me cuz they're different from like assassins creed or whatever kids play these days where you're just in a fake world and you control or make events happen in a fake world"
"I guess I'm just confused about why the context of these games needs to be the civil war, rather than a made up land like GOT or what not"
"Yeah I don't get those either! I guess I personally can't buy into those games or just am truly confused about why some people would like that"
"Not a criticism, I just personally truly don't get it"
"I guess!"

"What is 23andme"
"Which would be p shitty either way "
"You think Jeb bush would be a fine president?"
"Wow "
"Right but George bush wasn't fanatical and he was a really bad president "
"Davis, George bush was already president for 2 terms...He can't be president again"
"You're saying you'd rather someone be president who can't be president in this current election cycle- which makes no sense because it's impossible. It would make sense if you said you'd rather Jeb bush be president rather than Carson or trump. "
"Wow did I see an ""if bush were in this election cycle"" in the earlier texts? No. You find it and show me."
"I brought up George bush to say that ""less bad isn't necessarily good"". I never mentioned his being in this election cycle, even hypothetically, for a moment "
"That text in no way implies that"
"I know that, but then he shouldn't declare its sooo obvious that he was ""implying"" that it was a hypothetical ""if George bush were in this election"""
"Also, Jeb bush would not be a ""fine"" president - we shouldn't settle for an okay president, because that's where our state of politics is headed, towards moderate mediocrity "
"That's not what you said at first- if you wanted to make it clear then you should've phrased it as such"
"Lol Adil i appreciate ur attempts at peacemaking "
"Where is it?"
"Like what restaurant?"
"Oh ok! Yeah we'll join!! "

"Yeah I had been leaning towards alternatives but my boss said he thought equities was more structured and less up and down with how much work/learning is available (the person I'd work with for alternatives is really hands off and has many other roles, and the equities head is this guy I met this summer who I really got along with & is my boss' right hand man). And he said he could still give me exposure to alternatives in the other half of my job with the investment analytics department! "
"thanks team 😘"
