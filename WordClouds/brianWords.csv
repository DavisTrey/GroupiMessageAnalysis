Sometimes*
"I've definitely been turned down on airbnb cause of age"
"Yeah I'm saying some will allow some won't"
Lol
"I hate lmfao"
"That doesn't make the band good or even decent"
"One song that they didn't even write themselves that isn't any good it just gets played while people are drunk and it came out at the right time of year"
"Yes absolutely"
"Have you never heard the term ""song of the summer"""
"That's the song that ends up being #1"
"Bands like that- their only goal is to come out with the song of the summer"
"Absolutely "
"Wtf are you talking about"
http://m.billboard.com/entry/view/id/62418
"Party rock anthem is #1 for one year, and the next year is call me maybe"
"Perfect example"
"Carly Rae Jepsen is so great!"
"Fantastic musician"
"Yes that's true. But lmfao is still astoundingly shitty"
"I didn't even say party rock anthem isn't catchy. It's not as catchy as a lot of other songs I would put in that category but it is catchy"
"It's different though because lmfao assuredly didn't write the words or the music, and they don't play or sing great or show any sign of talent PLUS their music isn't even entertaining to me"
"It's different though"
"I wasn't talking shit about the song I was talking shit about the band. Movies are essentially stand alone so you can judge them in that way. The song I wouldn't talk as much shit about cause it's aight, especially at a party or something, but the band blows"
"Thursday evening J101 grand Budapest hotel lock it in"
"Davis that's totally fair but I don't even enjoy their songs"
"That one song is aight in certain situations "
"So many songs Id rather play even in those situations though"
"LMFAO is to dance music as pitbull is to rap "
"Yeah me too. The song is great except when he's rapping"
"They must not have opinions"
"Just as we suspected"
Classic
"Low delivery; low content"
"Goddamn it Leroy "

"That's some real baggage, bro. Maybe that's why he needed the roller backpack "
"So far from true"
"Fifa is a just pick it up and play whenever you feel like it, wow is like an alternate reality"
"Yeah but you're building an alternate reality and you have an alias and all sorts of things like that"
"Dude you are objectively wrong here"
"It's astounding"
"I don't even know what to say"
"Part of it is self-imposed by the types of people that play the games. You can't argue that someone who plays wow is much more likely to be a damn weirdo compared to someone who plays FIFA"
^^^
"Also true"
"If not like 5:95"
"Davis are you actually saying there isn't a difference in the people or there shouldn't be a perception of difference in the people"
"Because there absolutely is a difference in the people, and that is probably one of the main reasons for the perception of the people that play it"
"Ok well there is a difference in the perception, as there should be"
"So people who read high quality literature vs people who read tabloid magazines shouldn't be perceived differently as long as they read the same number of hours "
"People who train for mma 5 days a week shouldn't be perceived differently from people who run distance 5 days a week"
"Fine take my more recent example"
"Thank you Adil"
"Using extremes to make a point. It's a thing"
"Davis you have to know to some degree that you're wrong here"
"Yayyy Nats back and on the right side "
"Someone who wears super preppy clothes shouldn't be perceived differently from someone who wears emo goth clothing"
"I really think it's a stereotype that's pretty fair"
"So separate but equal? That's always seemed to work"
"No that's the definition of a difference"

"Nanataco is mexicanish but that got axed by our resident foodie"
"Nanataco >>> dos perros"
"Ok, here are the final options:

- Smashburger (or, with adequate fervor, a more ambitious burger venture such as only burger or bull city)

- Randy's Pizza (cheap, large, thin crust pizza)

- Nanataco (a well known taco establishment whose food, contrary to popular belief, has little to no flavor despite the creative efforts of the management)"

"Freedom trail is really cool"
"They have a sick market kinda thing too"
"The Freedom Trail is a 2.5-mile-long (4.0 km) path through downtown Boston, Massachusetts that passes by 16 locations significant to the history of the United States. Marked largely with brick, it winds between Boston Common to the USS Constitution in Charlestown. Stops along the trail include simple explanatory ground markers, graveyards, notable churches and buildings, and a historic naval frigate. While most of the sites are free or suggest donations, the Old South Meeting House, the Old State House, and the Paul Revere House charge admission. The Freedom Trail is overseen by the City of Boston's Freedom Trail Commission[1] and is supported in part by the Freedom Trail Foundation[2] and Boston National Historical Park."

"Hah you belong"
"Amy Jo I have a serious question about vegetarianism"
"Well, several questions"
"Ok so what I don't get about being vegetarian for ethical reasons is that people could make ethical reasons for not eating just about any food. Like fruits and veggies are often grown by people who are extremely underpaid and mistreated, and the argument could be made that treating those people almost like slaves is worse than some of the things done to animals. Not saying that the way animals are treated at some places is okay"
"Just saw an article about how terrible the people that work for Ben and Jerry's are treated"
"Ok fair answer"

"Ok idk if these questions seem ignorant to y'all but I'm just trying to learn... Why are antibiotics so bad and are they really just in meat"
"But what's wrong with that"
"Like... To someone hearing this for the first time it sounds like an antivac argument"
"Ok I was wondering if it was a resistance thing"
"Is it antibiotics that humans use to treat diseases or are a lot of them animal specific "
"Yeah that's pretty much my thoughts"
"So who is in support of steaks from a lab, that are for example 3D printed "

"I could explain it to you in extreme detail after taking IP actually "
"Music industry is less profitable than it has every been for musicians that aren't stars because of free streaming sites"
"Ad based streaming services provide 10% as much revenue per consumer that uses it compared to subscription based"
"And musicians still have as much revenue from cd sale as they do from all digital music. And I think we all realize how many people buy CDs compared to digital"
"So basically the sentiment that we deserve to get our music for free is fucking all artists that aren't famous"
"Taylor swift isn't really withholding her music for her own sake she's doing it for lower level artists that can't pay the bills because digital services don't pay them enough "
"iTunes is still digital"
"Paying for digital is *better* than streaming for free but that doesn't mean it's enough"
"Also - the deluxe version being on iTunes surely means someone else paid a ton of money to have an exclusive deal"
"Probably target because they were the exclusive sellers of some of her past exclusive versions of albums "
Jeezus
"Terrible argument"
"She doesn't want digital to go away she wants artists to be compensated appropriately. That doesn't necessarily mean consumers paying more it may mean services taking less or advertisements costing people more or a combination of any of those "

"Some nfl players are taking performance enhancing drugs that can't be detected? It's creating an unfair advantage? All the other players should adapt"

"Artists would LOVE to sell their music digital. It's cheaper to produce and easier to distribute. But they make pennies compared to dollars of physical sales. They just want it to be structured so that they can afford to do it exclusively digital "
"Davis imagine if you were  coder and your code was worth $X per line if it was on a piece of paper but if you emailed it to someone (in a way that couldn't be manipulated) it was worth $X/10 and everyone decided to take it thru email instead of paper and your salary suddenly dropped to one tenth of what it was purely because of the medium your work is being distributed through"
"Davis do you not realize you're being objectively destroyed right now"
