"Just anything, it was up yesterday too"
"And I can hear it from our room hah"

"Don donelson speaking truths"
"Hm yeah that's a good point. It just seems like if they were really that serious that they were discouraging people from even saying they were Muslim than they wouldn't have done a public thing elsewhere. Idk I could just see duke making up those threats honestly"
"He's from tip lol"
"But you're right Natalie I didn't think about that"

#econ
"Tbh if they are all the same price I don't really want the smaller room. It takes the guess work out of it by asking what you would prefer at each price "
"If we actually had done it and I really preferred the smaller one it wouldn't have had me paying the least but we didn't even try it haha"
"Does anyone want to get breakfast with me? :)"

"Pretty sure you're supposed to lock it then turn in the key"
"Davis I've definitely done that after they've said have a good flight lol"
"￼"
"Also can we all appreciate that Natalie somehow accidentally sent me this- "
"Highlight of my day"
"🙈🙈🙈"
"Oops sorry I was driving!! "
"Tito has a kid that goes to St Stephens haha so he was at the prom thing I went to.. I wish it was a more exciting story"
"Leslie and I went to take pics of her brother going to prom and to get free drinks lol"
"I wish we had been at the same one davey"
"I like it too!! Davey and big A"
"Haha who is this guy??"
"Anyone know Christopher penny or Nolan Russell from duke? "
"Lol thanks team"
"They're working at cornerstone with me but I can't find them on fb 😐"
"Haha plz stop"
...
"Cool davey!! Also oh god that is terrifying "
"we're working at companies too 🙋🙋"
"June 1st! Google sounds crayy 😙"
"It's so soon and we're not even back in the country lol "
"That's awesome Natalie!! Also guys I'm in front of the whitehouse and it's so small.. I'm so confused "
"Haha I was here in 7th grade and I swear it was bigger "
"I'm convinced I was at the backside.. Still investigating "
"Get itt"

"Love it. I've only heard it a couple times tho"
"Haha I feel ya"
"Guys I'm beer ponging with my coworkers and have to work tomorrow lolz"
"Yeah apparently it's super rare but I'm on a case with a really short deadline "
"Went to all the monuments!! And finally bought pots and pans so it was a success"
"Well not all of them ha but hmm the Lincoln memorial is up there. Also once played cards there with Mehul "
"I knoww. Woo! How's the apartment??"
"Don't lose your work building/elevator/bathroom key in the first week like I did"
"And don't email the CEO saying ""I'd like a small shirt please"" like I almost almost did "
"Adil is in crescent "
Ditto
"No we don't have to be there to get the keys, we just have to email and say who's picking them up "
"As nat said ha"
"Oh okay gotcha"
"Thanks Adil!! And omg Davis that's so exciting"
"Least funny in my opinion 😝"
"Haha I didn't want to come off as being mean so I had to add a lighthearted emoji. But it was a sincere statement "
"Weird.. Well my guy already arranged a time to get his key. But I believe Joanna said her guy is getting in at 10pm.."
"Around noon"
"Okay so just to clarify Joanna's guy is getting in at 10pm tomorrow? Or tonight?"
"Yeah it's fine with me"
"I would too"
"Well I guess get them and that kid can give them to the others"
"Sorry Adil for all the confusion"
"Just sent mine"
"Seriously ^^"
"Yeah Adil they're going to move them. If you could give the key you got from kaitlyn to Jos guy tonight that would work"
"Wait what.. we get the apartment Thursday so he wouldn't have to stay with anyone"
"They are so Andrew can get the bed out of that apartment because those guys aren't in Durham this summer"
"Natalie is sage in Durham now? If she got the keys from Adil tonight or in the morning could he get Andrews key?"
"He will, I'm gonna email him once we have everything figured out ha"
*she
"Yeah the girl is getting the bottom room and the two boys are getting the rooms upstairs "
"And can you give her all the keys plus the key from Kaitlyn? "

"Aw that's so cute!! Also what is a cheese blintz?? Haha"
"Omg that sounds amazing "
"Please try one for me"
"😍😍😍"
"That's for you to figure out 😏"
"Jk I was slightly drunk and wanted to contribute to the convo"
"Haha no I wasn't Adil, I like your thinking though "
"Brian that looks amazing "
"It's your relative Lefei!!"
"I would like to add that I have played softball and flip cup with the CEO. And eh I wouldn't say pro haha bout to learn SAS though "
"Adil what happened??"
":( "
"He needs to hire a second person!!"
"Uh yeah it's most important to him!! He sounds evil"
Hahaha
"I think we should do something because I haven't gone on FB trip with yall yet :("
"Lolz no thanks. Davis I think that would be fun! "
"Guys I spilled something on my duke sweatshirt and the freaking stain remover discolored it!! And I've looked online and can't find it and would pay like any amount of money for a new one 😭"
"Don't eat that shit"
"￼"
"Postcard I randomly have lol"
"Haha I don't even know why I have that"
"Guys I got a tinder this is so exciting 😁"
"Haha never. Someone just messaged me the pressure is on"
"Joanna they all do, even Natalie!! We're so behind"
"Davis I would say that's true at duke but not in other cities"
"I do but not 50% in big cities. Like at duke no one has a big need to tinder, it's not hard to meet ppl "
"I agree Jo "
"Hahaha 🙈🙈🙈"
"Brian those look awesome. Baseball is the best and also I'll be a flip cup champ by the end of the summer"
"Oh that trailer looked awesome!!"
"Can't wait "
Stopp

"👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👧👍🏽"
"👯"
"Hahaha guys I'm the one that actually took drivers Ed classes "
"And I stand by it"
"Well you apparently missed out on some classes"
"I have! Awesome but I will admit some parts made me cringe lol"
"I really like Lefko but would also say I don't know him that well"
"Definitely down to welcome him but I mean I think even he would think it was weird if I sent him a fruit basket or something ha "
"Yeah I agree with Natalie! "
"Yeah maybe we could hold off on the new group text for a bit? Cause I agree I think I would be super conscious of what I was saying haha until I know him better"
"Thanks guys ❤️ and yeah from the times that I have hung out with Lefko I think he's awesome so definitely down to get to know him better and welcome him in "
"Haha I don't really think that's true, like there are probably hundreds of people having the worst life"
"Or more"
"I agree Brian, don't think you should be the south battling the north but other than that don't see a problem with it "
"Guyzz I really want to go to the Supreme Court now!! How cool would that be"
"Hopefully it's still going on after I get out of work!"
Lol
"Abstinence 👍🏽"
"I AM OBSESSED WITH TRADER JOES"
"their food is gold"
"Wait Davis where is that quote from Rick Santorum about the Supreme Court?"
"Or whoever"
"Haha or what was the quote? "
"Haha I've been looking through all the group texts for the last 10 mins and can't find it :( it's okay though lol"
"Sarah was like trying to explain the idea that the Supreme Court overstepped its bounds (not that she believes that) haha but that actually makes no sense to me"
"They were literally doing their job"
" Hm okay I'll have to read it. Also I don't have those texts anymore I swear haha"
"Okay interesting"
"Haha what. I'll have to read it"
"Was 4 right? Guys there have been 6 shark attacks in the carolinas in the last 2 wks!! 🏊🏻🐬"
"OH SHIT"
"￼"
"Thanks Adil 😊😊"
"Davis I snap chatted you the same triangle I sent everyone!! And then Adil snapped me back ha"
"Yeah and then Adil sent me more snaps and I sent him one with face "
"I see where you guys are coming from but I don't have a problem with it haha"
"That's awesome!! "
"Yeah it's really fucked up, an uber driver killed a 6 yr old kid and the parents couldn't sue because they are ""contractors"" and they're not gonna sue the uber driver who has no money"
"Natalie that's so cool that that's your beat!!!"
"Have you read that ny times article about the prison in Colorado? Crazy stuff "
"Remember to pay rent! ❤️"
"Haha yeah I just remembered Natalie "
"Wut "
"Hahaha magic boxes???"
"Oh my god I just saw a guy in a bike get hit by a car"

"I said no Natalie but might've put one of the qualifying statements"
"Except Davis hates cauliflower "
"I mean cheese"
Lol
"Oh haha 🙈"
"I've been making cauliflower tacos!! They're awesome "
"Yes! This one has cauliflower and potatoes"
"￼"
"I can't wait "
"No haha that's not a big deal!!"
"Oh my god. This expert report that I've spent so long working on and came in both days this weekend for is almost finished and the attorneys just called and said they weren't gonna file it 😭😭😭"
"The amount of money banks spend on lawsuits is insanely huge. Like they paid us so much for this report and just decided they didn't need it haha"
"Nat that's so true, his approval ratings must be up"
"Also I don't want to rekindle this debate. But just want to say that everyone at work loves 500 days of summer and they concluded that if anyone thought it was sad they must've recently gone through a break up "
"Lol 🔪"
"Yes! We did a lot of things like that"
"Natalieee why are you taking all these classes I take later and not when I take them??"
"Ugh. Haha who do you have?? When I took it it was so easy but Joanna's prof seemed harder "

"Now it's the time to leave that the schedule says and I'm like ""are we going to leave?"" And she says I always leave 4 minutes after the schedule to avoid overlap. Then why did you hand me the schedule????????"

"Who else wants to come? It'd be good to figure out how/when we want to get there "
"Jo is in too"
"I don't either meh :("
"And maybe we could uber there but I think ubering back would be way too expensive. Taxi could be a better option "
Yess

"Yeah they do so if we wanna drive over we need to go early, like Jo was thinking 6:30"
"I know, or I guess if we go later we could just risk uber prices"
"The whole thing closes down at 11 tho so it's an early night anyway"
"When would you want to go?"
http://www.unc.edu/campus-updates/homegrown-halloween-to-be-held-on-franklin-street/
"A lot of streets are closing at 8:30 and residential streets will be barricaded off early in the night and only residents of the st will be allowed to enter"
"Even if we could legally park somewhere at 8:30 I really don't there would be spots available "
*doubt
"Obviously I don't know what it'll be like but if I'm driving I don't want to risk getting there at 8:30 and there being no spots. If someone else wants to drive and try it tho I'd be find with that?"
"I think it could be fun if we got there early and got dinner/drinks but also we could cab or uber later if we wanna do stuff here first"
"Also chipotle is doing a 3 dollar burrito if you add something unnecessary to your costume"
"Just so yall know the idea behind the chipotle thing is that you have something extra on your costume that isn't necessary (because additives are scary lol) so maybe brings a random accessory "
"That is so unnecessary!! At that point just make it short answer "
