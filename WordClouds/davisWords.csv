"Who in North Korea besides the government would do something like that?"
"That would be the #1 suspect IMO"
"Dude Adil the average person in NC has no education, no Internet, no nothing "

"There aren't ""secret hacker sects"" or whatever in NK. "

"Duke wins!!!!! Triple overtime last minute dunk "
"Did the interview 🙀"
"It was alright. I think I had a pretty good answer for the product question. I don't think my answer to the estimation question was ideal "
"I made a slight mistake on math which looks really bad I think "
"Overall it felt good, but I'm not sure it would be considered great, and I think for this type of job you really have to have a stellar interview to move forward "
"It was about re designing an airport terminal "
"I actually think I had some good ideas but perhaps they weren't as bold as they should be "

"Brian I'm unsure if I would be able to go on Christmas "
"I would imagine it's being played for a few days after "

"CNN mentioned some chain in Atlanta and Alamo Drafthouse"
"North Korea just got owned by a DDOS attack "

"Noooo Joanna :( "
"I think down in the valley is my favorite. "
"I still need to spend more time exploring their less ""top"" songs though. Haven't listened to full albums "
"That's actually the only song by them I haven't really liked "
"Rivers and roads "
"Every other song I have really really like "
"Lol. I like Shake a lot too "
"I just don't think I like the ones where the girl sings as much. "
"? "
"My Friends is good too "
"I think on a lot if the girl songs there is much more vocal focus and much less beats/instrumentation. I just don't get into that as much "
"Did y'all see this? ￼"
"Connor is so funny "
"It's a picture of a nice tweed pattern with a receipt obscuring part of it "

"Natalie I'm in this gourmet candle store you would like it so much "
"No lol"
"Mehul, did you know party rock anthem by LMFAO was #1 in United Kingdom, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, Switzerland, and the United States"
"AKA, conclusive proof LMFAO is the shit "
"You can't fight the facts "
"I love them"
"Voice of reason? Naww. There's nothing wrong with admitting that a song that is simply catchy and energetic can be good. "
"A band that makes good songs isn't good? "
"You think the song coming out at the ""right time of the year"" is what led to it being #1 in like 10 countries? "
"Okay go release a song next summer and let me know when it hits #1. Any random yoloer can't just make the ""song of the summer"" "
"I'm saying the song's success can not simply be attributed to the time it comes out because otherwise every summer song would be like that. There is something about the song itself that is good enough to propel it to that level "
"Say what you want but call me maybe was a catchy song that people loved. You can't deny that... People use the excuse ""oh it's just drunk party music blah blah"" but either way millions were still listening "
"Adil and I will jam out to LMFAO alone then 😎"
Lol
"Adil just cornered himself"
"See I suppose when I say ""I love LMFAO"" I am saying I enjoy their songs "
"Don't stop the parttttty"
"Haha some pitbull songs I like "
"I wasn't aware Leeroy Jenkins was such a widely known thing "
"Right. But there are a lot of videos out there with millions of views you may not have seen. I only know about it because I played WOW in middle school. My assumption would have been people who did not play WOW would not have been as likely to see it"
"No we're not!!!! "
"(Haha see that was funny 😄)"
"Yeah bro I had a kickass Tauren shaman "
"That game was dope and gets undeserved hate. It's no different than someone playing FIFA"
"Explain? What's the difference between a kid in middle school playing FIFA vs. WOW? "
"Why is one labeled a loser nerd and the other labeled normal "
"You can log on and play wow whenever you want. "
"Okay yes it's a different sort of game? But I really dkbt see how that means anything "
"Dude I'm totally open to changing my opinion but I see no logic argument against my point "
"If one person plays one video game for X hours per week, and the other plays another for X hours a week, why is there SUCH a difference in perception "
"Yes I agree some people get super addicted to WOW and just play it 24/7, but I am referring to an average person who is not "
"I think, if person A plays FIFA for 2 hours a week and person B plays FIFA for 2 hours a week there should be ABSOLUTELY no difference in perception of them "
"Both are just recreation activities. I think it's unfair to label one so negatively "
"You are seriously saying FIFA is analogous to high quality literature while WOW is analogous to tabloids? FIFA and WOW are both video games you play solely for entertainment. "
"Tabloids vs literature are read for very different purposes"
" WOW you talk with other people on the game all the time. "
"Look, here's my point. I recognize there are differences between playing FIFA and playing WOW. But I think there are unfair stereotypes regarding one vs another. If you met a kid and knew they played WOW, your perception would IMMEDIATELY change. Whereas if you met a kid who played FIFA, your perception would either stay constant or improve. Whereas I ultimately think whether you choose to do one or another for video game recreation dkesnt really mean much about who you are"
"I just think those stereotypes are unfair "
"Is that not a fair belief? "
"When I say no difference in perception, I mean no difference in positive vs negative perception "
"You REALLY think that's a fair stereotype to label someone? "
"THATS THE VERY DEFINITION OF A stereotype Adil. "
"Just because a majority are a certain way doesn't mean you can assume an impression of someone "
"WTF. Replace Adil's last text with ""the average black person commits more crimes than the average white person so you can assume black people are criminals"" "
"It's an identical argument "
"This is actually unbelievable to me that you guys are arguing it's okay to label someone based on a factor like that "
"Like I'm baffled "
"Adil that was the stupidest argument I have ever seen "
"Lol "
"I'm impressed we went from Leeroy Jenkins to this "
"I kind of wish Mehul was still broken phone so he could load up his iPad tonight and see our hundreds of text diatribes "
"""Woah guys"""
"""In other news I went to per se"" 😁"
Hahaha
"I could totally see him doing that "
"They'd all have cool random patterns/designs"
"Meguk I can't really explain why. It's just something I could see happening "
#JustAMegukThing
"""Guys I just was the music curator for a local durham restaurant"" "
"Most Mehul thing I've heard recently "
"Wait Mehul I know the new thing is Applebee's but didn't you start with one in durham"
"Davis Treybig's song Reccomendation of the day: ""The Pretender"" by Jackson Browne"
"My song is actually a legit recommendation for you stop trying to ruin my thing "
"See that's a 100% Mehul thing "
"Yea Natalie hates those for some reason"
"NATO straps rock though "
"This is ridiculous. A guy pulled a gun on an officer in Missouri and the officer ended up killing him. People are rioting? The guy pointed a gun at the cop...."
"It's on the news 4 officers were attacked in the riots, yet this video clearly shows the guy pointing the gun "
"Haha wtf"
"I've never seen anything like that "
"The bathroom of the restaurant I'm in has like 10 colognes ￼"
"This restaurant near my house my parents really like"
"Plate. My parents love it. I'm really not a fan though"
"I would guess not"
"I mean, the foods fine, but IMO it's super overpriced"
"Sady and I wish you all merry Christmas ￼"
"judgement is the one where we write down the stuff on the cards?"
"oh yea"
"whats judgement"
"oh judgment is the modification on fuck the dealer?"
"we should play those games more they are my favorite"
"judgement/fuck the dealer"
"oh wait i am so stupid"
"fuck the dealer is my dice drinking game"
"judgement is the modification of what I used to call Oh Hell"
"my point is: I want to play judgement more lol"
"I always played if you have the original suit you must play it "
"I think "
"I googled it. I'm pretty sure what I said is correct according to this website"
"Yea BOI "

"I think I would drop out of duke "
"Like I know y'all are more exciting than me culinarily and most nights I will probably just want to make some grilled chicken and steamed veggies and potatoes or shit like that, so don't want to be a Debby downer or anything "
"Ja feel"

"I hope everyone is watching spurs right now 👍👍👍👍"
"No were just watching at my house "
"Nice Natalie! Can't tell you how much I approve"
"I'm so surprised all of y'all's families are willing to watch the interview. My parents wouldn't early never want to watch that "
Literally*
"Oh not cause of being scared"
"They just would have no interest in seeing it"
"I really want to watch it. We went and saw the imitation game though, which was pretty solid. "
"The one about Alan Turing "
"Russel Westbrook is so god damn good "
Jesus
Haha
"Can someone explain to me why everyone is shitting on the cat video I posted to Facebook which is actually pretty funny "
"Adil you better have watched the video it's actually really good! "
"Wtf is this new mentality. ""Don't Instagram a sunset unless it's the best ever. Don't show me a funny video unless it's the funniest ever"" there's nothing wrong with sharing something you happened upon that you like"
"Also a brief story of that post. I post it last night. I expected at least a few likes. After like 4 hours Ruth liked it because she said she felt bad about how I had no likes. Then Alex liked it, but he said he never even watched it. Then chris Woodard randomly comments ""why"""

Yo
"lol that's why I asked yo"
"To see if people were hanging out"
"""What's up team"""
WTF?
"I ask what yall are up to 40 minutes ago to hang out and no one says anything? "
"Looked to me like he was unsure if he was coming cause he was working :( "
SIKOA
"Amy it probably has to do with the way you have aligned the margins on that line"
"So it is ""centered"" within the margins that are set, but not centered on the paper"
"IM DOWN BRIAN"
"guys lets get a team ABP crew going"
"3:15 ABP everyone be there "
"So why is this still splitting? "

"What a pleb school "
"Tbh though I think it's reasonable "
"Grad schools often have higher acceptance rates"
"Business can be low too"
"Stanford is like 6.5%"
"Do med school kids just flood apply a ton of schools?  "
20???
"See but if every kid applied to 20"
"Of course admission will be lower"
"It's a self fulfilling prophecy. Kids are scared of low rates, so they apply to a ton, so schools can have low rates "
"Compare that to law school where I would guess kids often only apply to like 5-8"
"Question: do you think ""prestige"" of a school matters as much in med school as it does for law or business"
"Right. So that could also play a role "
"Med school kids can apply to way more schools cause prestige is not as important "
"Whereas an MBA kid won't apply outside the top 7 or so "
"Of course there are haha. But I'm talking about quality candidates. The perceived difference in balue between stanford/harvard/Sloan/duke/etc vs the rest is so massive a quality candidate for MBA I don't think would even consider below those top schools. It's not worth it"
"Maybe I'm wrong 😱"
"But even if some do I think that skews it a little. I doubt ANY med school students would say ""well I didn't get into top 10 med school so I guess I just won't be a doctor"". A business student can keep working without an MBA"
"It's important but often not necessary. IE if you work for mckinsey they will pay for you to get one and once you come back you are auto promoted, but you can 100% get that promotion without the MBA "

"(And anything you skipped you would know)"
"you're telling me in 70 days if you could skip med school residency etc"
"You wouldn't?"
"You're telling me you would rather in life be a shitty ass 80 hour a week resident than get to be your dream job and help people sooner? "
"Except it's not like that because you get to go to your dream job "
"obviously you learn a lot but that's why j included the fact you would auto learn anything you needed to in this hypothetical scenario "
"Very interesting. "
"Not quite sure I understand, but aight"
"Right, but you can work hard as a doctor. Like if I could right now skip all the learning and interim shit to get to help found a startup with some other incredibly smart people and work on that, I would do it in a heart beat "
"I'm still working, but I'm working on my dream instead of the ladder to reach my dream "
"I want to hear a girls opinion "
"Natalie would you skip all the interim stuff to get to your final, dream position right away "

"Headshot part is interesting though "
"What does certain type mean? "
"Mentally unstable? "
"Do we know for sure that it was religiously motivated though? I just think killings like this are often sensationalized to include things like that at the outset without anyone really knowing. It's definitely possible it was religiously motivated, but from what I've read it seems we don't know yet. All the police have said is the parking thing, which is why that's what I mentioned "

"guys.....this is not good. So i have confirmation they absolutely under no circumstances will allow 3 people in a 2 bedroom or 4 people in a 3 bedroom. In the past years this was allowed, but this year there are new owners, and the new owners won’t allow more people than bedrooms in an apartment"
"i asked regarding exceptions etc and they were extremely staunch "
"yes, and she said there was nothing she could do"
"yea i first talked to Olsen  i believe who briefly confirmed what i just said, then talked for a while to Jo Ellen"
"who was very direct"
"the reason is that it is less economical for them - more people using water,utilities, etc"
"yea and what i am guessing happened is"
"she thought that was true"
"then she checked with the owners when we asked about 4 in a triple"
"and she learned the owners aren’t allowing that"
"i specifically asked about 3 in a double"
"she said not allowed"
"yes they are the new owners of erwin"
"so we need to figure out what we are going to do ASAP because these papers are due tomorrow...."

It instills a feeling of absolute disgust in the viewer. At no point in the rambling 2 hour fiasco of a film did I have a single moment of entertainment. it is masterful only in its ability to anger the movie goer in every way possible, and then more.

"Should taxi companies keep crying about uber? No because eventually they are guaranteed to lose."
"From a business standpoint they need to adapt "
"First, I'm sure taxi companies want uber to go away. Second, yes that is exactly my point. They can complain about bullshit fees that they have had to pay, but it won't do shit. "
"Dude you seriously completely disagree with me? Technological innovation can't be stopped. If I'm the owner of a business in an industry getting disrupted I worry about how to adapt my business to accommodate the trends of the world if I care about long term success. "
"Brian that analogy is ridiculous "
"Why? Why should someone trying to be a taxi driver have to pay an unnecessary exorbitant fee as an arbitrary barrier to entry? It's an out dated policy "
"Uber is ridiculously strict with drivers. They have to maintain like a 4.9+ rating and need to have new cars and a number of other restrictions"
"Lol I'm not being destroyed. My point is simply this (in reference to your analogy). If it was clear that this x/10 code thing was the new way of doing things, I'd obviously be upset, but it would be in my long term interest to figure out how to adapt and profit more off of that model rather than try to cling on to the original code thing until I no longer could.

"I read the New Yorker one. I dunno. It talks about how in Belgium people do it for things like anorexia, and how now 13% are non terminal illnesses, how there are young people doing it now, and how they are starting to be way more lenient about doing it. I fear that in some cases these people could really be helped and live out happy lives - maybe the process has become too accepted and common in Belgium? I'm reminded of how an immense number of suicide cases, if they fail, the person is glad they survived later. "
"That being said I do support euthanasia for those that want it - i just worry that in places like Belgium maybe it is too straightforward to do now in non terminal cases?"

"Shhhh go back to your golf game Mehul "
"I agree Adil - it should be seen as a last resort type of thing. People should have the option if they really want, but it shouldn't be pushed. Cases like anorexia...that can be fixed. People can be helped, and their life can change. In a way I think that pushing euthanasia so hard tricks people in those cases - they incorrectly believe that the best option is to die, since suicide js so acceptable. "
"It puts patients in a more naive state - unaware of what is possible and defaulting to euthanasia "
" I don't mean that literally... Certainly you understand my point? "
" if 50% of all deaths are euthanasia and kids are taught about it in second grade and doctors bring it up with the patient for all forms of chronic illness, it has taken on a more prominent state in society. In fact - I would argue that the ""secular humanism"" group in that article sounds like it does almost advocate for it "
"I think it should be this - there should be no legal restrictions on people who want it. But, there should also be no education about it to young children, no doctors highlighting it as a primary option in non fatal conditions, no advertisement of it. "
"This conversation is very related to the discussion we once had about the girl with treatable cancer "

"Actually looks like they just don't have room for a lot of people on Friday regardless:( :( :( I'll try to find another place and get back to yall. "

"Is John mulaney  that guy Yall showed me the hysterical stand up of in j101 once? "

"Yea Joanna "
"Adil what top tier comedian has tickets less than 25-30 dollars? Lol"
"Mehul there's 9 of us in reservation, minus Brian, plus Joanna and friend. But my guess is maybe 1-2 others would not come? So maybe do like 8 or 9 person reservation?"
"(9 of us for escape)?"
"mehul you good to make 9 person reservation? or want me to? "
"No chance we could roll in and get room for 8? I'm guessing? "
"Id vote guasava or the Turkish place "

"Joanna....please tell me you are joking. My point wasn't that George bush should be president..."
"no i didn’t mean JEB. I was responding to her text"
"holy shit joanna follow the logic of our texts. I saw jeb is a rationale candidate relative to all the republicans. You say, “oh but so was Bush and he was bad”. I counter by arguing that IF Bush were in this election cycle i would RATHER him than the fucking crazies in the republican party. "
"thus supporting my stance that Jeb shouldn’t be discredited given those he is running against"
"￼this implies exactly that"
"lol you have to be kidding me. Your LOGICAL POINT was that I shouldn’t support Jeb Bush just because he is rationale. My COUNTERPOINT was that, actually, that is a reasonable thing to support since even Bush, who you tout as someone who was a terrible president, would be better than half these republican candidates due to his relative rationality. I was not saying that George should run for president now or something. I was simply refuting your argument"
"you say “rationality isn’t enough because bush was semi rationale but bad”. I say, “actually, bush was good relative to all the current candidates” "
"whether or not we should settle is a separate topic. I merely suggested he would be fine"

That gives a comprehensive background. Basically a committee at Yale sent out a long email telling students whT Halloween costumes are okay to wear etc. then a professor at Yale emails her residential college with a email saying that while she understands the importance of being thoughtful with costumes, she is also offput by how much the administration is therefore controlling students, restricting their free speech, coddling students, etc. it's a more complex email than I can do justice right here"

"Anyways since she sent that students have been protesting, raging, camping out outside her house, calling for her resignation etc"
"And also harassing her husband, who is the one in the video I sent and who is also a yale professor "
"But the things these kids say are just so ridiculous "
"I’m not denying more is happening at Yale - that absolutely seems true. I just saddens me how the students react specifically to that teacher, simply because of an email which offered a separate point of view"
