random GIF of the day: ￼
exactly
lolz this is what i was trying to send earlier. i ditched my phone and went to get my computer so i could send
secret
but there’s no way this tops mehul’s CRAZY gif of the slight slap in the face, right?
impossible
￼
i didn’t it, it says Brian did
￼
WTF
see my pic above
who wants more random gifs? (me)
￼
Davis make this app plz? ￼
￼
￼
￼
i like weird ￼
￼
￼
Ahhhhhh this is a good one:￼
A+
￼
￼
brian i knew you’d like that one
￼
hahah very nice
i’m surprised none of y’all have complained about my gifs yet
￼
￼
eyes are cool
brian y’all do this in wrestling right?￼
Ophthalmology can def be cool, yeah Davis. not too much variety i think though 
Davis lets add that pull up to our workout plz
perfect ❤️
￼
￼
no mine seems random
￼
￼
￼
wtf?
what happens without condoms:￼
￼
^this is one of my fav gifs for some reason i love it
no joanna that tree is most definitely a plant
#whitepeople￼
yeah joanna ruins mine too
￼
^why would you ever try that
a second is clearly not good enough. Davis, i feel the pain as well 
i twitch every time i watch 
sowwy amy, i’ll stop now
i followed davis’s advice as well. don’t think it worked but maybe it will.. joanna talk
ok this is promising now
i does
?
so strange
😎
Mehul you have to tell them about last night’s dinner
i was the only one that responded last night, good
goob*
didn’t want to wake you up if y’all were sleeping
i gotchu mooshoo
everyone is fine. go mehul
yes tell us MORE mehfool
plz?
Mehul TELL THEM how much money was spent
Davis, “>>>>” means “really really good” or a general sense of approval
he is being slow as fart, i’m about to take over story
To answer your first question Davis, the people are people from the BCG office
to answer natalie’s question… the prix fixe was $310
THEY SPENT $6600 ON 6 PEOPLE
WTF
wtf mehul don’t do me like that
i thought it was just a lot of nice wine
(Jo as soon as you started talking my group text split, and now everybody is appearing there…. you’re really screwing me)
$8000? chump chance
CHUMP CHANGE*
how was the aged beef?? different from normal beef? also how often do they do this??
apology not accepted, it just split again. you could stop talking
thank you
aw
did bcg pay for all or what?
that certainly goes over the $50 mark………
so can they just do whatever the heck they want if they ask nicely?
uh huh
so did they actually make reservations months ago or pull some strings? i assume strings……. how
guys i have a general question
when wine costs $1000/bottle………. is it REALLY worth it? like does it taste THAT good? you could have the full 9-course meal 3 times over for the same price as one of those bottles..
someone enlighten me
so then WHYYYYY waste that money
yeah i’m not asking about your situation specifically, just in general why people do it
meh whatever
Go for it big guy, you’ll be awesome
:D
Hahahahahahahaha amazing
Anybody know what corn dogging is? #welcometoTN
￼
hahahahahaha i highly doubt that is the middle school definition
#only10isee
👌
😘
😉
wut.
😳
😮
ok team, question: what should be my winterr break show?
New girl? the league?
finish parks and rec and west wing?
have i watched all *great* shows then?
what about like ER?
i actually haven’t seen friends start to finish 
what is boardwalk empire about
meh
davis HAVE YOU watched sherlock yet?
sounds depressing
oooo
whats the premise again
ah yep just read netflix description
do you have a good website to watch it?
AGH mehul who you play with?? what’s different?
i see
Sheesh
wonder if evan thinks its cute
nooooooooo
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
and you just split mine
😮
I thought it was funny?
😁
hahahahaha http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/johns-hopkins-mistakenly-says-yes-to-hundreds-of-rejected-applicants/2014/12/16/20b5f9f4-8575-11e4-b9b7-b8632ae73d25_story.html?tid=sm_fb
also wtf, the North Korean government was responsible for hacking sony? Are you kidding me?
i know i saw all that
i knew sony got hacked, didn’t know it was the north korean *government*
knew*****
but yes hence my surprise
well i don’t know what north korean life is really like, sorry. i would imagine that the brainwash they’ve suffered might result in some people being crazy on their own without the government directly ordering them to do something
also lol: Drake is currently commentating on the Toronto-Brooklyn game
i imagine *someone* does
interesting, i thought the average person in north carolina did have some education or internet. 
maybe everyone should move to scandanavia, like the netherlands right davis?
lol
i’m still confused. average person in NK has no education…?
“The national literacy rate for citizens 15 years of age and older is over 99 percent.”
“Children go through one year of kindergarten, four years of primary education, six years of secondary education, and then on to universities.”
one of their most prestigious universities focuses on computer science
i thought it was in the realm of possibility there could have been SOMEBODY in the country who might’ve done something like that without the government
i’m not at all talking about the average person
thats the whole point, some loon did it, not an average joe
it’s a fact that there are 12 mandatory years of education
look it up anywhere
yes, on american websites
and i’m not saying there are tons of hackers running around, just saying that it wouldn’t be unimaginable that ONE person or one small group figured it out
hahahaha
what were you referring to brian?
hahah is everyone in this group out of memory
ah nice
sheesh davis how
do you download a lot of music? you’re mostly on spotify right?
ah
whah. have y’all seen the full promo video for apple watch?
woah**
i know some of y’all have said you don’t like it, but it seems like a cool piece of technology
Davis i remember you saying you didn’t like it, what were the reasons again? i agree the thick square face isn’t the most aesthetically appealing
but this video is just cool: https://www.apple.com/watch/films/#film-design
hahaha
i gotcha
once they make it thin in a couple years i’ll snag it 
Jo that sounds awesome!
Is that where you might work after graduation then??
😮
Please nobody talk about the Duke game tonight on the group text, I won't be able to watch it until later 
Thank you Joanna
How was it?!
We shall see we shall see. What was the product question?
Indeed! Good work man
Natalie won't let me buy her lingerie 😭 don't you think 3 years is a long enough wait?
She still says no 
I agree, she's probably playing hard to get
I wish 😏
Hahahaha YES
Joanna Amy what the heck, you'd rather hook up with Natalie than me??
Apparently they decided that…
HAHAHAHA 
LIAR
I can't handle this lying
Can't even talk about this
THE BAND IS VERSATILE
She said I can't wear it because "it's too nautical"
I completely agree Davis
THANK YOU
I don't give a flying poop about this girl saying "I think it's horrible@
This is the same girl that suggested ridiculous fossil watch
Thank you thank you thank you to my boys
They've got my back
I completely agree it's a baller move
Totally me
Yes
I roll with polo quarter zips on sweatpants too. It's not about brand it's about the confidence 
These guys get me. Natalie = slayed. Game over

😳
Sounds dirty
Yo
5:5
😉
I'll be here all week folks
Boom
Did Sony change their mind about releasing it or did they steal it or what? Or were they always allowing smaller theaters to take it?
Nice
Try not to get North Korea'd plz

Lol yeah can we just slow down an entire country's Internet? That's awesome 
Right that
#thanksObama
I want galaxy cafe
I'm mirroring my phone on the tv and it's truly beautiful 
Much fun
Hahah amazingly phrased question 
Lol
Cmon girl. A long receipt
😎
5:5 for life
Lol
😔
Disaster: all my yakarma randomly just disappeared. Wtf
😍
Davis I thought of you every time I read that
Yeah wtf why just Mehul
WTF DAVIS
I thought we were all friends here man
Forget you. Hooker
Yeah rubbing it in our faces 
LOK
LOL
Joanna, what are your plans for New Years?
Wait Davis, who are you talking to now?
Hmmmmmm. 
Spurs paraphernalia? Nice watch? Sexy cologne? Nice shirt?
Lol
(Sorry late to the party)
Mehul I already thought that and tried to let it go but.....us
Ya*
Lololol at "Any random yoloer"
Very nice
Lol
Me and Mehul on same page
I will jam with anyone anytime
And watch (almost) any movie with anyone
Mehul I'm down for a retry 
Although the original statement was supposed to imply that I would watch almost any movie *once* with anyone 
Wait I take back the "anyone." Some people suck. But anyone of my friends of course
We might as well movie this to boys text
Move*
Why girls no talk
#truth
Davis........it has over 41 million views....
I think we are capable of arguing about truly anything. 
I dare you 
Lolol 
Much truth so wisdom
Woah. 
Woahhhhhh woah woah. 
I can't even get into this
Hold me back
The whole WOW mentality does not lend itself to that style of play though. People get legit addicted to WOW and it, at least more so than Fifa, tends to become addicting. Also, a game based on the worlds most popular sport is different from an obscure alternate reality based on dragons and warriors
Brian don't you mean 50:950?
Also, as a kid who played both s nerdy online game and FIFA, I know that I had two different sides, nerdy and normal
Davis can we talk about this message again? I've read it 5 times. Am I missing something that doesn't make this painfully obvious? "I think, if person A plays FIFA for 2 hours a week and person B plays FIFA for 2 hours a week there should be ABSOLUTELY no difference in perception of them"
^yes 
Not specifically analogizing them, just explaining how different versions of the same activity can and should lead to different perceptions
Only about the game though. FIFA brings people together more casually, less addictive my, and they talk about more than just soccer
Less addictively*
I appreciate your sentiment though Davis
WOOO natalie
Yesx100
Davis, I understand what you're saying. It doesn't apply like that to everyone. But if you found the average personality for a WOW player and compared to the average personality for a FIFA player, I believe you'd find a difference. 
I agree
A decent stereotype. Not a law
Also why would you not capitalize "stereotype" there?
HA I knew you would go there
Let's talk about proportions 
How about the example of Muslims, which is an example dear to my heart
Sure, idiots make generalizations about all of Islam because "Muslims" are doing a lot of violence in the world. But that proportion is about 0.0000000001% of Muslims. Compared to say, 50% of WOW players being legit nerds. Difference. 
Hehehehehe
😉
Haha ok I'll finish here. Again... I was using extremes to make a point. I'm not actually saying 50% of WOW players are nerds. Nor am I saying nerds are bad. I'm just saying there is a DIFFERENCE between wow players and FIFA players that stems from a legitimate difference in perception of the two games. 
lolol
classic
also now my boys text and group texts keep splitting and its extremely difficult to keep track of
hahah would be excited to see his reaction
“wtf people”
“i bought $400 in boxers”
boom there he is
why would you not?
you know you want to
definitely.
some random obscure asian silk boxers
i feel you davis
we know meguk better than meguk knows meguk
it’s just a meguk thing, you know?
#thingsMegukDoes
😎
“guys i just rekindled a aromatic flame from 2nd grade”
romantic*
wait wtf whats happening at applebees mayfool?
someone explain. curating what music?
i didn’t even know people “curated” music
Adil’s song recommendation of the day: “party rock anthem” by LMFAO
😎
Why do i feel like “😎” accurately sums up my attitude so frequently?
i’m a smug SoB
😳😳😳😳😳
😁
Hahahaha what that's amazing
How did Applebee's just know to contact Mehul Mehta?
Sounds quite un-riotworthy, but of course I don't know the details. Eesh what are people smoking in Missouri 
Oh no
Wait so if you perform armed robbery 3 times in 18 months you still don't go to jail?? 
Eesh
😳 where that
Me want steak
Thank you sady
Mehul what's the name of that card game we play 
Judgement thank you
Attempting to teach now
Mehul how many cards for first hand if playing with 3? Is it 7?
And play 13 rounds?
Kewl 
Does anyone remember this rule for judgement?
If you have the suit originally played by the first player and also a trump, can you play the trump or do you have to use the same suit?
Hahahahaha
How funny would it be if we actually prevented Davis from cooking for himself
Happy holidays everyone!! 😉
Nah
I gotchu Davis
Hahahaha
I did don't worry
But I've seen roughly 800 funnier videos 
Hahahaha dude I liked it chill, just thought it would be funny to start the "why" train
I also liked the video itself
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
so basically I'm your only real support...again... You're welcome
So true 
DDMF
Holy hell that was beautiful

I care!!! That's awesome!!!!!!
Go Joanna 🎉🎊🎈🎉
no
saw that too. interesting moves by the big fella
hoe
Happy happy happy New Years 🎉🎈🎊🎉🎈🎊🎉🎈🎊
😍
I want you all to appreciate how bad my hometown yik yak is. Snapshot of current events:￼
No idea who TH is. Loudon is my hometown. Iowa, dear Davis, is a state in the midwestern United States
Vols played Iowa yesterday. Fool spelled Iowa wrong. Your phone realized that. You did not
Thought you'd like the Mehul 😊
that*
Woah Joanna how'd you get your yakarma so high??
💜 you meguk
Also everybody please appreciate Natalie's bizarre response to my recent request:￼
I don't mind an occasional dear
Davis. Where is your iOS 8. 
My god natalie what the hell
Your new emoji use is terrifying
Amy you don't have iOS eight do you?
yes all of my group text are splitting
Yeah same here 
They were split before I name them…
thank you Joanna 
Who's about to call The Crew 3?!?
Lol
Exactly how I thought you'd feel mehul
Same here
Wait what did she say freshman year again?
Cool guys
Anyway: SB15. Start Monday?
No I actually meant trip start Monday
😦
Monday-Sunday
Potentially Tuesday-Sunday
What yall think
If yall wanna go straight I could join late
Brian wins emoji game
Glasses no doubt
Or BOTH?? Cover your bases
😎
We need to have at least ONE full crew pic asap
Hm
Loopskies or sushi love
Guys the new Bostock first floor, aka The Edge, looks so sick
Omg this place is beautiful. Like link 
Yeah yall suck. This is why we boys text
I have work to do. But guys this place is great. Touch screens outside every study room to reserve them
And they're so nice
Guys I know you all want to start black tenting tomorrow RIGHT?
Loop lunch happening now if anyone wants
I know you all hate this establishment apparently though
Yeah that's not possible or correct in so many ways
Dang it BC entrance closed ugh
YES JO I LOVE IT
it's a short year!!!!
Oo good call Nat
YES YES YES
White will be EZ
Heads up: 12 black tents already registered
does anyone know where to a poly for funding to travel to a conference? Joanna, didn’t you do one? Or was that through robertson?
sigh. anyone know any other sources? DSG have anything for this
?
yes
ah yes SOFC king!!
PLZZZ give me monies!
There’s a conference at Harvard that I got accepted to. It’s for leaders of research groups across the country to come talk about the best ways to get undergrads involved in research, etc. 
hmmm who are these deans
cheapest round-trip airfare i found was $238
Pretty long 
But I'll try to find out when checks are and tel you
Just go sign up early morning
Mehul knows the drill haha
Correct answer: yes
Davis can you send me link to some info about these Deans' grants? Can't seem to find it online 
Twould be really great, thanks
Davis apparently YOU are the guy who knows all about my funding needs:￼
It's officially for DURS, which is a group that helps hundreds of students. The conference would give us lots of new ideas about how to make our group better and hence help tons of students 
That doesn't count?
I didn't solo yolo apply, it's for the group
I would be the only one going but it is entirely for the benefit of the group, not me
Again, knew you'd appreciate that Mehul 😁
Potentially Lefko will go too
That would be great. Unfortunately they require that we confirm our participation on the 6th.....
That makes total sense, of course I understand. It's annoying on their part to give such short notice 
But one day when you need brain surgery DONT COME TO ME FOR HELP
No sir. I've made a note. I don't forget. 
Notre dame taking it to UNC at UNC
dying
too much work
For you guys as the semester begins 💚https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=901650959863788
On a Wednesday morning would one of yall be able to drive me to the airport?
A flight at 10:30am, so get there 9:30, leave 9?
Lolz no Wednesday the 21st
Plz?
I love you
good luck
First of the year ￼
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MEHUL!!!!!! Enjoy it big fella, can't tell you how much we all love you. See you soon homie!

YO. First 50 students in line for game get to make surprise video for Coach K. GET IT
(not sure if that's on the DL - don't tell anyone)
First LMs should be there 7am tomorrow. How early can you be there?
Hahahaha
Davis Brian or Joanna, can Mehul register one of you guys? Just in case we call a check and there's nobody there so that there can be somebody to run over and save a spot
You guys are beautiful 
Nearby will work! They'll sound the siren. Ill try to tell yall if there's a check ahead of time, but I'm in class much of the day
yeah try to stay as close to the door as you can.. don’t wanna miss that siren, plus y’all will be one of the first groups checked
haha yes of course i’ll try
By the way Nat and Brian, it looks like Mehul isn't lining up til later so I don't think you have to worry about it
If any of yall are trying to blue tent: register ASAP, we're about to hit the cap. Doubt it but though I'd let you know
Lol
We in dis
No Mehul is being lazy
Most people probably in their tents
Can Lefko take 3rd spot or someone else want?
Yes no maybe??
Which part?
Nat you don't want to go do you?
And I mean doors open at 7:30
Brian you going right?
He's not sure yet 
Will let you know asap
Could Brian take 7-7:30?
7:10 whatever
Yeah I doubt it too..
I'll ask around and make sure. Mehul where are you?
Lefko has a meeting until 7 but can come after
No line check
Davis I'm under blue tent in kville
Giving third spot to Lefko, chill?
Ok then
Yeah doors at 7:30 so be there
Lefko will be there as well
There's a chance yall could be in video if you get here at 7 but sounds like no right?
Lefko will be looking for Brian and Mehul
He's running there
😘
Davis you don't really want to work there. Skip it
Hell yeah
Grabbing quick lunch at penn now if anyone wants to join

“‘The game just got away from me," Anderson told the San Bernardino Sun on Friday. "I didn't play any starters in the second half. I didn't expect them to be that bad. I'm not trying to embarrass anybody.’”
“But Bloomington coach Dale Chung says Arroyo Valley used a full-court press for the entire first half to lead 104-1 at halftime.”

Wrong chat but no I'm not still in library haha
Stupid splits
😞
it’s sad… she’s changed
natalie is your phone updated..
not the question at all. you should be willing TO pay a lot for the chance to kill hitler
killing hitler is absolutely desirable…
i assuredly wish to do that, yes
you don’t have to take pleasure in the actual taking of life, but it’s a moral responsibility if given the opportunity
don’t be silly
wth. you’re telling me if I took you back in time and gave you an un-painful euthanization to give to a sleeping hitler you wouldn’t do it??
but MONEY would change your mind? wtf
that’s sick
who are you
$5? $10?
i’d pay a lot
you said in agreement with jo you would do it for 150 mil
twisted because it’s unrealistic, but the moral question is easy
you wouldn’t pay to do it to prevent the horribly painful deaths of millions of innocent people?
…
you are so wrong
ok
whew. ok hopefully everyone’s messages will show up here?
omg
amy davis jo??
brian i’ll head there soon. how long you up?
wow this amazing
hell yeah

test
i’m about to run to mcD

Natalie stop making group split PLZ
I am king of acronyms
loool
Davis come to basketball game meguk has 2 spots
Sexy
Do any of you cool cats want to plan things for me to do in
Boston?? I suck at planning. Currently envisioning myself sitting in library for majority of free time, but figure I should give the city a shot while I'm there
What's freedom trail?
Thank you Davis
I am excited to eat clam chowder 
Ew art
Ooo
Word. I've never explored a city myself before 
Ahhhh sick. Sounds pretty cool
Amy how do you know about Boston?
Ahhh right right 
Oo I could probably shoot him an email! 
^made my morning
And thank you Amy!!
Hahahaha natalie is this real "South Korean activists funded by the Human Rights Foundation are preparing to drop 100,000 copies of “The Interview,” the controversial film that prompted the cyberattacks, from balloons across North Korea in late January."
Amazing
Ok everyone, don't cheat -- poll: what do you think Harvard Law's acceptance rate is?
Thank you for participating Davis
Surprise: 16%!
Isn't that so high??
Pleb indeed. But across the board, law admissions at top schools way higher than ugrad 
Is med school the only one that's so painfully low?
Yeah there you go
But like Alabama med has a ~6% acceptance rate
It's crazy
Average is like 20, so sort of? But out of necessity because admissions rates are so low 
Probably more like 15 for med. But yeah idk what it is for law school. It's sort of chicken or the egg style I suppose. I think there's just less kids that want to go to law school 
Hence easier to get in with similar size classes
No I don't think it does, not at all 
Residency is much more important 
That doesn't necessarily deter kids though. People still want to go to the "best" med school I'd say just as much as business or law
I'm sure there are kids that apply for not-top 7 business schools...
How do lower business schools stay... In business? Hehe
I agree with Amy 
"Majority" being key word. Sure some kids think like that
It's just interesting how different they are
But isn't an MBA still a fairly important part of their goal? It's not just an "eh whatever" thing
I mean I think it really just comes down to way more people want to go to med school. Hence only 40% of total applicants get in ONE school. I'm sure that number is way higher for business and law etc
Dead serious
Correct
Yep
"Devote life" up through ugrad, that is
Hahahaha
😁
I literally cannot fathom. And it actually happens to so many people
yeah if you fail once it's very likely you fail again
Become neuroscientists I guess
hahahaha
...
Believe it or not people do actually go to grad school for neuroscience and get a PhD and then actually DO neuroscience for a career looool
I'd say reason number 2, number 1 being "I don't want to be a doctor"
CS and engineering definitely more applicable in the real world
truth
Med Schools kind of screw people by saying "major in whatever you want you can still be a doctor" and then those kids that randomly major in English and then don't get into med school can't do anything after college
Do it Davis
Hahahahahaha 
If be curious too haha
In a sense - at Duke and all other top ugrads, it's 85%. But that's still 15% of DUKE kids not getting in ANYWHERE out of 20 schools
But like imagine going through ALL of pre-med: these tons of classes like orgo, physics, bio etc nobody wants to take... Doing tons of EC stuff -- volunteering, research, etc... Taking the freaking MCAT... And then not getting anywhere. Ouch. 
Davis: that gif is painfully on point and painfully an understatement
oh yeah definitely. Most kids coming in with intent of being premed don’t apply. At Duke: 40% come in pre-med, 10% apply
sure but it’s still different from other professions. like i’d say business and law also have a significant number of “eh I don’t want to do anything else so i’ll do this” kids
^certainly
Brian’s gif: also on point
you’ve got to be kidding me
HAHAHAHAHAHA omg Lefko just thought it was Obama's first term....
He's still so confused
He "sincerely apologizes"
😳
Holy moly. 2 of the speakers at this conference: Editor in Chief of Science and also the most cited engineer in history 
Wth
Ants..?
Host is already f'ing me before I meet him. Turns out he had to go do something so he can't take me to his room until night... So I'm lugging my suitcase with me all day
Hahahaha
Plz
I'm intrigued 
Also so amused that you have to spend time this way
Lul 
Loudon > Cleveland 
Durban >>>
Lol London sucks
Also, guys..... Harvard is ugly af
Mehul fails 
Stfu 
HAHA 
Brian and I are only English speakers 
Plz 
Plz let's all rush AEPi next year as mega troll
What's the yak Davis
Hahaha you told us that joke forever ago.. Saving it for a rainy day?
👏
Successfully infiltrated MIT
All nerds, can confirm
Omg... So I basically just walked to the other side of Boston to go see this "super awesome reflection pool". Finally get here. Pool is all dried up. Cool
I've seen. So tempting 
😦
I ain't doing that crap for nothing
Hahaha. No
I have a different philosophy with all this. The goals you reach only feel like accomplishments knowing you put in the work to earn it. If I just got to "become" a doctor without work, or get a million dollars for doing nothing, it devalues the experience. It's not even fun, at least not long term at all. Not a satisfying way to live
It's like when you use a cheat code in a video game to automatically get a trillion dollars and buy any car you want. Very fun initially, but you don't feel any real sort of attachment or accomplishment or satisfaction 
Yes Davis I would
Residents help people
It's part of the whole process of becoming a doctor. It's not *just* end goal...
Now if you tell me I could save all that time ANDY feel the burn of a residency then sure I'll take free time. But not just the knowledge 
AND*
Exactly I just told you knowledge itself is not enough
It's the work put into learning it...
I mean the reason any work is ever satisfying is because you reach a goal knowing you worked hard and deserve it
*most work
Guess we just disagree
For me, residency is part of the dream, not just a ladder
Sure it's hard but I imagine/hope it's also very gratifying.
The answer very much depends on the career path
residency is almost like being a full doctor -- it's not just rote crap. In fact, you ARE obviously a doctor, you have your MD. And learning how to save lives is fun
(and hard)
 Med school to a certain degree is the same. It'll be the first time I'm actually learning information that I'll be using in my career. If anything, I would've wanted to skip undergrad
but then I actually want to go to undergrad because of the social experience etc.
put it out?
i honestly am disliking harvard right now… whats ½?
1,2?*
to be fair i haven’t actually been given a proper tour or anything, just vague thoughts
Wow. Host Albert's wall:￼
Update on how much Albert is absolutely f'ing me:
Ok so I went to bed late last night after working, around 3:30 or so. We were supposed to leave at 7:45. I set my alarms appropriately and as I start to get ready Albert says "well technically we don't have to be there til later... I don't want to go now, I slept late... Let's go later." So I said okay sure we can spare the half hour and not be there at registration. THEN HE JUST F'ING SLEEPS FOR another 3 hours and now we've entirely missed registration and breakfast, only awoken by a fire alarm. I say crap, the first keynote literally started 10 minutes ago and I'm still here, so I start getting ready. He STILL isn't coming. So I just leave. Stroll into keynote half hour late. Awesome. 
Yeah he supposedly had alarms set for just a bit later and I thought he actually cared about ATTENDING this conference 
Albert is my sick excuse of a host
I've never loved/missed Duke more
Yes Natalie and its on you to NOT SPLIT THE GROUP TEXT but I don't see you doing anything about that
THANK YOU MEHUL
Exactly
I set 3 early alarms and was up and ready to go. He was like "nah"
Also he was supposed to take me to this building because it's supposed to be hard to find
He just didn't care
He just sucks, man
They match us up with hosts
Also I slept on the hardest of floors last night. BECAUSE HE WAS TOO LAZY TO TAKE HIS CRAP OFF THE FUTON
wtf
He said "do you mind sleeping on the floor tonight my futon isn't ready"
Thank you Davis
Plot twist: no longer has red hair
Plot twist: one of the worst human beings ever
Brian that's sick!!!
Well done friend, well done
^agree with Davis 
It's long enough to where it's reasonable to ask
YOOOOOO
THATS AWESOME
Has anyone talked to natalie recently? Tell her to talk to her mom!
Please
OMG
ALBERT STILL HASNT CLEARED HIS F'ING FUTON
And now there's another kid staying here too. 
I asked if one of us could get the futon, and he says "actually there's quite a bit of stuff on it"
Hahahahahahahaha
Oh my. Made my day
Yeah this kid blows
Just so baffling how he thinks this is an appropriate way to act
He's clearly just sucking around on his computer all day. And right now. He has nowhere to buy. Just move your crap, man
nowhere to be*
Brian would destroy this kid
Hahahahahaha
I love you guys
And... In all seriousness:
Hahahaha I hate this school
hell yeah
Dude what the heck 
YOOOOO GO BRIAN
That's sick man, congratulations 
Like you verbally abused Albert
Natalie it's your fault for doing this
What's the yak?

studying 🙈
cmon amy, do better
Interesting 
😮
Guys I woke up all of K-ville with bullhorn, gave high fives to the entire team, heard funny speech from Coach K, gave pep talk to tenters, personally yelled “great game” to Tyus who responded with a “Thanks man!” — i love this place
mehul it’s always a pleasure with you my friend
Goodnight friends 
Prolly bangin
Hahahaha one of the line monitors got so excited last night he broke a finger and probably has to get surgery

At least a broken arm
Hell yeah. 
Oh yes, priceless commenting from Davis

looooozerz
i got to watch the replay of the last play…

he’s not singling them out, they’re the only ones that haven’t said anything
My phone has somehow managed to COMBINE the text group from Mehul and... My mother
😮
down
whatup
sorry
oh i didn’t answer Jo’s question
Jo it entirely depends on what seats you want. if you line up in the morning i can try and tell you when checks are
HELL YEAH davis
great right??
Jo don’t ask silly questions. minimal line up, then walk in at tip, i don’t care, but you’ll have crappy spots
davis that’s what i’m sayin’
thats the good stuff
thank goodness someone finally joins the right side
y’all will catch up eventually 
everyone coming to game??? YYYEEESSS
true brian’s not bad
davis its wednesday. skip dog

😮
hahaha very nice brine

can we PLZZZZ post it as a leak
^davis is right
good try mooch
mooshoooooo*
mooch could be a good nickname too doe
me and brine on the same page
davis plz leak that screenshot exactly as is
mooch is failing at cover up big time
mooch, can we have an anonymous platform post leak plz?
HAHAHAHAHA YES
plzzzzzzzzzz
where is that? can we just go snowboarding instead?
huh?
oh. well lets just go somewhere with enough snow
nah bro. Aspen sounds nice
so if people actually want to go skiing, i could do banner elk. how close is “closer,” mooch? If not though, I vote blowing rock
fair nut
nuf*
ah ok 10 v 30 minutes is meaningless
i’m down for either honestly. blowing rock just sounded like it had more funtivities
i would prefer we went first weekend but whatever works best for y’all is fine
Guys I just had the coolest experience with a patient. Like a 70 year old lady. I walked in initially just to bring her a pillowcase, but then we just started talking about everything. She told me about her life living out west, how she worked with computers for 30 years after getting her degree on a whim from a junior college, she told me all about her two kids lives as a nurse and an the architect, the silver lining behind her divorce, we talked about the Super Bowl and sports and Super Bowl commercials, she told me about crazy people living at her retirement home, and she made tons of recommendations for boys road trip out west that we probably won't take but were still really fun to talk about. Just talked for like an hour. Gah I'm excited to work with people 
Wtf that was so stupid 
Low content; low delivery
this is amazing: http://www.foxsports.com/buzzer/story/alabama-high-school-2-0-basketball-bibb-county-brookwood-020315?adbsc=social_20150203_39880627&adbid=874690209261301&adbpl=fb&adbpr=744152948981695
top yak is at 617 ups, woah
yeah it’s pretty intense
holy hell. I think like 85/85 top yaks are about LDOC
Ok yeah In my entire feed i found 1 yak that wasn’t about ldoc
this is brutal
impressed by the level of unity here
wtf like serious ones? 
no way
my god
dat’s whack
 cmon people
that’s absolutely insane
hahahaha that would be too meta
no way those goons thought of that
wtf no, everybody knows what LDOC is you don’t need publicity
adil’s wild plans: hiking, sleeping, enjoying the views, basketball, board games, talking, cooking (eating), snowboarding?, and movies
^true, + all that
😞 i liked my ideas..
mmm don’t act like y’all aren’t gonna do some work
davis are you joking
you tried SO hard to do it over fall break and RAGED at me for fake-forgetting your backpack 
goob
Mooch is slacking
i don’t care
ATTENTION: all those who want to attend fantastic basketball game tomorrow — plz register for line ASAP. I’d recommend early tomorrow morning. I can try and tell you when all checks will be so hopefully you won’t have to be out there all day. There actually will be checks doe. It’ll be a great game — first one at home after 1K; Nike giving everyone free t-shirts, there will be commemorative tickets, and K is giving a speech!
162 people in line
soooo who wants to go to game tomorrow…
saturday
or sunday, i don’t really care
i’m not even going to be there, probably
yeah that’s the whole reason i preferred first weekend. if this fam vacation happens i’d be out thurs or fri
can probably get in, seats won’t be great
again, i highly recommend just going and writing your name down early tomorrow morning. worst case scenario you get bumped and sign up again. but hopefully i can tell when all checks are
not gonna fight it
meh i’ll say sunday. sometimes its nice to have a buffer time upon return before jumping back into the full-on swing of things, but an extra day of vacation is nice. although my opinion is likely meaningless because i won’t even be there 
Mooch would also like our opinions on preference of average temp of 44 degrees banner elk v 42 degrees blowing rock, and if we prefer average elevation of 610 feet vs 612 feet, and what our thoughts are on higher density of pine trees in banner elk vs blowing rock
 Tennessee with dat number 4 recruiting class baby
bad first
Mooch coming’ in hot. well played. “HE ON FIYA HE ON FIYA HE ON FIYA HE ON FIYA, BOI, HE ON FIYA HE ON FIYA HE ON FIYA”
Yeah 
Bout to listen to the GOAT

i’m trying my best… wtf
yes and this weekend is miserable for me
i have 0 time
early feb. i’ll send an email right now to the lady
Boys, are y’all okay with me saying we’ll move in early? I’d be able to move in June 1 because i’ll be in Durham. Also, Lefko should be around for a month to split rent. Maybe Brian too. 
I won’t say anything specific, just that we’d be willing to try and work something out regarding early move in
I shouldn’t up our chances by sweeting the deal with the early move in?
Yeah i’m not guaranteeing it would help us, but I figured it was worth a shot and we don’t lose anything
also i actually do need a place to live this summer
I’m just trying to help…
well done davis, looked good
Brian wrestling team is hosting info session about the sport??
😮

STANDING 5 FEET AWAY FROM GRANT HILL
In Cameron. Think he's calling the game
Hahaha LM walks out of bathroom just giddy. "I just peed in the stall next to Grant Hill. Oh my god."
Still space on the sides if yall want in!! It'll be fun
Yes you will
Oh my. OH MY
LETS GO 
What the flying hell
43-7 run............... Are you kidding 
Matty J ballon hard
Beautiful half. 
My god.......
That first half was one of the purest beat downs I've ever seen. It's definitely up here, especially considering circumstances. Maybe like top 7
That shooting was absolutely wild. We were like 86% at one point
Also we were so in their heads. When i checked they were 21 PERCENT from the free throw line. Are you joking?
Mmmmmmmm
Multiple air balls were so fun
Of course homies, I really didn't do anything but glad he enjoyed it! Where yall now?
Jo did you get to go?? Anyone with you?
hahaha wtf
dorky asian kid in front of me in library is absolutely jamming to k pop music videos right now
43-7 is just too much. it’s seriously a beatdown in the purest sense of the word
and wasn’t ND the team that has 1.2 points per possession?
demolished
Yeah he sat out the last 11:37 or something
hahahahaha
also it was so comical watching their players trying to get excited when the got the lead down to like 20
lol yas
Listen to all the panties dropping https://vine.co/v/OUmIw6LBpph
Well deserved 
Sheeeeeeeesh
can’t say I haven’t been there
Guys I did some crazy stuff in lab today — my first transcardial perfusions! Basically, I anesthetized a mouse, pinned it down crucifixion-style, cut open it’s chest, hijacked the circulatory system to swap out blood for my own chemicals by poking a needle into one chamber of the heart and cutting another chamber out, then decapitating the mouse and cutting out it’s brain. It was awesome
*its
How do you use roku to watch the duke game? I found watchespn but it's asking for a pin?
John Stewart leaving the daily show??? agggghhhhhh

mehul i will crush you. come out guns blazing
MORTON
i will apply just to beat morton
we must make him loser
lol
Guys I just realized I’m closer to becoming a doctor than I am to freshman year of high school. Weird…..
sure sure whatever, but for me actually being “doctor” was always so far into the future. 6 years isn’t THAT long… 
not in my head
it’s always just been “so far into the future that i can’t really imagine it”
also, i’ll have the chillest doc name ever. “Doctor Adil.” Much chill — that’s like calling you Dr. Davis. i dig
thank you jo
yep
we haven’t settled on specifics yet, different ideas being thrown around
Anyone up?
😭 gnite Crew
Unbelievable 
I'd like to see evidence for the parking thing. Like how was this guy not locked up earlier if he had any thoughts remotely like this over something so small?
Like this is clearly an overreaction for a parking dispute. If this guy is inclined to react so radically to such small things, you'd think something else like this would have come up earlier indicating he was crazy. Like chances are he's had something equivalently bad as a parking dispute happen at some point in his life, and it'd be noticeable he was crazy by how he reacted to it. Or this was just a singular moment of insanity. But I just can't believe this is a parking thing
I think it's clear that's what we're insinuating Joanna 
Getting quick lunch at penn if anyone wants to join
Yessssss thank you
Sure I get that. But such an intense moment of brutality supposedly triggered by something so small only comes from a certain type of person
I'm with you amy
Also who else is saying the parking thing? I only see Fox News talking about that, but maybe everybody else just doesn't want to
Yeah hence my original comment, I'm curious how they know it's "just parking"
i got nothin
I was going to email last week but y’all told me not to. so a while ago
wtf NO you did not
you said “chill”
don’t give me that crap

yeah i was looking for a map
no
she said ours is the same as yours
no how could i, we didn’t even know if you’d get it..
she just said the 3 remaining apartments were all the same
this could be crazy
yeah i’m quite sure we have the same floorplan
ok we just need to make sure we can find a way to put all 4 guys in… apparently the owners say only 3 people can live in a triple…… 
option 1) argue with them. they allow 3 people to live in doubles
wtf are you serious
who did you talk to? name?
ok but if 4 is fine then worst case davis just lives in that apartment
phew
ok
oh
well back to option 1) why can’t we put 4 in a triple if they put 3 in a double? smack ‘em around a little bit. 2) be sneaky and hide one of us. challenge: just logistics… like an extra pair of keys or whatever. but seems doable?
anytime they need to be shipped something we could just write a diff name? shipping address doesn’t have to be same as billing
also wtf, they “other occupants” spot on application has space for 4. what is this tomfoolery
who is they nat?
I don’t know that we ever specifically asked? Nat, when you asked for the apartment, we were planning on Davis living there and you and Jo rooming, right? so you said 4 and they said nothing. Do you have that in writing in an email?
ah i see it now
i feel like that’s fair then. We made it clear that we intended to have 4, and we weren’t told otherwise.
Should we loop Mary into this conversation? Jo Ellen is the one f’ing us
Omg... Research bro just now asked for a 3 hr meeting from 8-11pm tonight.........
"Sounds good!"
Lol
How long yall there?
😐
no worries
see emails to natalie earlier. it was explicitly stated that we had 4, and Mary never said that wasn’t okay. also we might have asked in a different medium, in person?, and they said it was ok
yeah *phone
^^yeah 4 on the waitlist is very clear. Davis was one of those names, right?
and did they not tell you anything when they called about the 4 you’re supposed to have??
Davis check with Nat to get all the info from her side, i gotta go pray now
but sounds like it was quite clear
Lol tit
You tried general number?
Because I realized without the usa today it could just be like an iPhone pic from me instead of a nationally published one
Wtf
I'm about to go there and bust the door down
This is a problem
this lady is a goof
they open tomorrow? 
doubt it..
Jo ellen didn’t know a god dang thing about that law, she said she just wanted to ask the owners
lol
jesus. did you tell them we weren’t told about this before when we put ourselves on the waitlist? when we PUT 4 people on the waitlist?
who? Jo Ellen?
did we ask why?
Jo Ellen literally told me on the phone “I know they allow 3 people in the doubles”
2 days ago
wtfffffffff why
also, do these owners own all of Erwin?
right. i reiterate mehul’s question
probably true
girls make sure you fill out housing form asap plz so we can go turn them in today
sigh.
Mehul me and Nat driving over to drop off soon
Also: Mehul and Nat, i’m ready to drive over now.
So Jo: literally now
whenever mehul and nat can go
sure thang
wtf is on east doe
loool
also GIRLS: don’t forget $50 application fee check
Amy you in on this? Also, do any girls have an envelope we could have?
They boys are covered
What do you mean, y’all don’t have checks?
Davis rooming with Lefko at crescent

I could maybe do after 9
Someone's in trouble

uh
20 mins?
i’ll try, maybe 5 min late
End of middle lot i tihnk? Mehul?
gonna be 5 min late
I'm walking
Lol
Joanna, I’d come across that earlier but didn’t get to read it. Thanks for passing it along again — seriously great stuff. Laughed out loud multiple times
Of course. It was a good day for some laughs, the Monday blues were very alive
y’all should all read it
also I apologize for saying “y’all should all”
haha the TN in me took over
i take back my apology
Ate 2 free dinners. I'm out
hi
Hell yeah http://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2015/02/column-do-better-unc-fans
Not at all
I definitely consider it the latter
I'm pretty sure it's used exclusively to mean the latter
But I could be crazy
Hm Amy I'm inclined to think that sign is intended as a play on words of the actual meaning. But like I said maybe I'm crazy 
Second comment is cracking me up ￼
I'm not saying it's ONLY ever used as that, clearly Amy found a place where it wasn't. Just sayin' I thought that that's the much more common definition and if people use it the other way it's supposed to be fun because it's the opposite of the usual. But who cares, f me 
As in the actual definition, yes
That's like saying a phrase that's cleverly used as a pun actually means the punned word
Ok whatever
I stand by my opinion 
Also in that gif, can we talk about how the kid that gets slayed is the only one not wearing that red shirt? I want to know the context for that scene so badly 
Nobody's going to make posters saying "life's a bitch"
Although that'd be hilarious
Some real top notch stuff
Thank you brah
Ish was above our pay grade but today we rose to the challenge
Now I do
i’m sure i’ll forget in 2 days so then you’ll have to explain to me 😃 
but yes it was exciting when it actually happened haha
BOOM
She did it on purpose... 😕
😜
Hahahahaha 
How do you know he's her bf
Tru
Game at 9
👏
Hell yeah
lol
wut was it
Omg. My test for next Friday just got pushed to the Monday back from SB.........
F. Me. 
😮 
I've seen both
Life is a lie
White and gold when I invert 
Black and blue
What is it supposed to be
Yeah when Zoya sent to me it was opposite of first time 
Everyone sees the same colors don't worry. My red is your red. This is some voodoo
The proteins in our eyes, the opsins, transduce the same wavelength of light; light is the same for all of our eyes; it's going to have the same intracellular reactions which give the same sensations in your brain
The unsatisfying bs explanation floating around the Internet is: After a minor freak-out (because I somehow saw it both ways at different times), I asked my friend Ben, a postproduction supervisor in Los Angeles, to weigh in.
You know, the people who make your TV shows look good between filming and the time they hit your screen?

According to Ben, the photo — taken with a camera phone in poor lighting — casts the whites in a blue tone and mutes the gold to a darker color.

People who see blue and black are seeing the photo at face value. People who see gold and white are compensating to the photo's lighting and aesthetic.
So it somehow might have something to do with all the things you've been looking at recently the lighting surrounding you etc.  I don't know though honestly 
I think it's a tech kink. Davis computer scientist plz explain
Hahahahahahahahahaha
http://www.wired.com/2015/02/science-one-agrees-color-dress/
It's legit blue

although i actually found it interesting. it’s just a lot of material
i honestly am forgetting who’s who at this point
down for improv
brian i can hopefully join — not sure what time yet though
dear lord
Davis is that with huettel??

blue is colder
SENIOR YEAR BABY ￼
research independent study. so that cuts out 15 hours a week but still
infinitely nicer than any semester i’ve ever had
wtf?
Very cool
Jah is such a baller
But almost every other teammate mentioned how odd they found it that Okafor always listens to smooth R&B to get ready for games, like John Legend or Alicia Keys.
"Who told you that?" Okafor said suspiciously when asked. "That's true. I listen to some John Legend. Dang, they threw me out there."
But he couldn't help but grin.
Another freshman, Grayson Allen, has been struggling with a lingering illness. Not long after the ACC Player of the Year was named as such, Okafor brought Allen some chicken noodle soup.
Seems like a nice dude, JAHfeel?
sorry just ate
?
#truuu￼
Robertsons aren't interested in service?
I jafeel all of that, I love most of the Robs I've met, the yak just made me chuckle
also team: who’s in for improv??
would be a sick class to take as group
bro download turbo scan. so clutch. makes iphone pics look legit for labs
👍
looks like a 4-eyed smiley face
My god. I come into the room and I've never smelled stronger weed. And I see this: ￼
The boy is wearing my shark hat. And my class notes, like open paper, are somehow stuffed under my shoes 
What? I said I was interested earlier. Mehul can you take??
Holy moly all the boys in improv would be TOO good. 
YES
do it
 What bio class?
Mehul thinks infectious disease is awesome? Have a heart man
But actually what time 
Who am I kidding I have almost all the time slots open
Difficulty level?
HAHAHAHA no the last thing on earth I need is another bio class. I probably have at least 15 NS's
But I could be down for that, although improv would be more fun and different and easy
check me out ￼
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
hahaha
thank you sir, ‘preciate that
Tonight blows. Tomorrow night party 
Yes....
Yes............ 
I 110% did
Did you know that TX stands for Texas?
Referencing the state of Texas?
I bet majority of people know. Not all but majority 
I very much appreciate the sentiment 
I want to learn cool facts from yall 
For example, did you know "www" stands for World Wide Web?
Mithun was working with someone, and mithun just left but this kid is just staying in my room working...

and yes i know duke was ’63 but that’s still closer

holy moly
what was their tone? they weren’t like bragging were they?
yeah that’s pretty bizarre
sheesh
beautiful
hahahahahaha
i don’t flock, thank you very much

what kind of a bologna quote is this, Will Victor? “One major part of strategy is identifying particular strategic moves”
it’s 63.5 degrees……. IN ANTARCTICA
warmest temperature ever recorded on the continent
to all you food chicks, did you see this class called “politics of food?” Explores the food system through fieldwork, study, and guest lectures that include farmers, nutritionists, sustainable agriculture advocates, rural organizers, and farmworker activists. Examines how food is produced, seeks to identify and understand its workers and working conditions in fields and factories, and, using documentary research conducted in the field and other means, unpacks the major current issues in the food justice arena globally and locally. Fieldwork required, but no advanced technological experience necessary. At least one group field trip, perhaps to a local farm or farmers market, required.
i don’t want to take it, just making sure y’all already knew about it
😘 
dinner plans crew?
anytime anytime
ya boy’s hungry
i could do it, or loop or pitchfork
i’ll come now
y’all going now?
I had q shack yesterday 😐
^^^^exactly what I was about to say
If it is what it is then obviously it's horrifically disgusting. There's no opinion to be stated
Agreed Davis
Joanna, I think our point is that this is so blatant that there is no "opinion" on the situation, with what we know now -- it's just insane. There are no other ideas to "engage" with other than speculation on the event itself (eg who really did it, etc, which is impossible to know). I also don't think we're "ignoring" it -- we know it happened, and we aren't pretending it didn't. We are also plenty "conscious" and "aware" of it. Of course we're upset... That goes without saying.
Cameron!
.......
Dear lord
👏👏
DUS consent required....
Get for me plz 
Is it ALP or CZ?
✌️
davis……you don’t need to take that class……
Don't text plz
Game over Adil wins

I think they play in Cameron because duke is underdog right?
To make things fair?

Sigh. Hopefully it'll pay off
Luckily my mom said she could drive for an hour so I'll try and make a dent now and finish when I get home. But yeah.. Eesh

Tooooo true ￼
i suggest flexing as hard as you can
for real
I think I just got offered a post-grad clinical surgery research job in Canada
It'd be near Toronto. I don't anticipate actually taking the job but at least I have a fall-back and won't be unemployed! I was talking to this Canadian surgeon because a Duke guy recommended him and he just said they'd love to have me even if I don't get Fulbright which was nice
Haha thanks thanks, no biggy at all but thought it was funny 
D’aw thanks Tingle!
Just saw a dead duke squirrel. Summer ruined 
thank you for your empathy jo. 
Mipso concert was awesome!! Did yall know there's a new concert in September?!!

Lol @ "major syntactical error"
HAHAHAHA 
YESSSSSS

❤️❤️❤️❤️

loooool
Davis go back to school plz google making you dumb
Just 2 couches and a table
Joanna — if you go back to the email from Jo Ellen, she says go to www.timewarnercable.com to set up cable or internet
😘
Just wanted to share this memory with you all: Davis casually strolling in late to Brian's 21st bday shenanigans wearing shorts in heart of the winter cold while carrying a fresh bag of baby carrots alongside his briefcase, acting, in classic fashion, as if it were completely normal ￼
💜💛
Don't spoil GoT plz 
Joanna go to sleep
Oh my god this made my day, please read and see pic http://www.danspapers.com/2015/06/hamptons-police-submarine-unit-makes-first-arrest/
Hahah
Same
Girls do I need to pick up all your keys tomorrow or just Joanna's? Like do your subletters have a way to get their keys?
Yeah if you guys tell me who they are and give them my contact info I can try to meet up with them
Did you guys call the electric/Internet people to get it set up for them?
Ok I'd call Erwin to let them know none of yall are actually in town since typically you have to be there when they do the Internet stuff so double check they can do it for you 
Mhm
Yeah I would really call them tomorrow and explain the situation
Yeah I'm getting your keys, I'm just talking about Internet
If you could make one of the subletters your designee to be there for Internet person that would great, not sure I'll have time this week
Also fyi the phone call to set up electric and Internet today was about 45 minutes long so block off enough time, make sure whoever calls knows everyone's birthdays
Plus your own social number 
You're welcome Joanna :)
there’s an option on the phone that lets you sign up a new residence
I think the exact codes I typed in keypad as I went were 3-3-1-2-2-1
then once you set up energy, they connect you to internet people
there’s only one type of “modem”… but the plan we got was “turbo” though we’ll probably downgrade one level
okay these are the plans we had to choose from, and I rolled with turbo but like i said probably downgrading to standard ￼
you don’t have to pick anything else
i would assume that yes you want home wifi….
they default to the $8 online, you don’t need the better one
default to that on the *phone
i told him i have 3 dudes who need to do college things and he said this was fine
there’s no contract for Time Warner so you can change if you need to
it’s seriously much easier over the phone… you can ask them all of these questions
but yes i highly doubt you want to self-install
you have to get into the Erwin cable closet and mess with their stuff
also i’m not doing it
i was addressing davis; there is no person there to do the self-installation was my point
DN are the funniest group joke of all time
i agree with dave
^agreed again
🔥
GO TO HELL DAVIS 🚒
how’s everyone’s summer going? ⽕㊋
📬
my favorite sport is soccer 🏇
guys davis is laughing hard 🎭
like, calm down amirite? ☎️
Ok GIRLS attention please: I have to pick up all your keys or none. Jo wants me to get hers but Amy and Nat now don't. What do I do
They won't separate keys 
Yeah these ladies are all God dang confused. Don't know how this will work because they won't separate keys
Ok Amy is that okay?
So Joanna's kid has to sleep with me tonight
He's getting here tonight 
Okay one of you send an email to Joellen right now allowing me to pick up all keys 
They need written permission 
Okay we should be good 
Joanna's guy still has to sleep with me because apartment isn't ready until tmrw afternoon. Jo can you tell him that and give him my number and tell him to text me?
By noon 
I'm just going to give Jo's guy the keys and he and Andrew can meet there around 12
Jo plz confirm you got my message later and tell your guy he can spend the night at our place
lol Jo Ellen wanted to rip my head off
Question #2.... Do yall have beds for your subletters coming tomorrow..?
Okay
Eesh
Okay also they gave me a form for apartment inspection so that you can note if something is messed up. Don't really have too much time to inspect apartments today so I can give them to your subletters or just hold on to it, preferences?
K. Also Jo do you have a bed coming?
Cool
By the way crew we're bay 723
Ok so can sage or Andrew be at Duke anytime during the day tomorrow or do they want to meet me after 4:30ish
Is sage a girl?
Hahaha she'll have a fun summer
Amy, the keys from your big -- what are they for?
Gotcha, and he knows everything about like what apartment it is and everything right?
Also, yalls individual subletters know which rooms are theirs right? Like they are taking the room you guys decided to be in?
Kewl
Where is she sleeping tonight?
Ok I texted her
Yep. And she knows she's distributing to the others?
I'm meeting her soon
👍
Keys have been handed off 
PORTLAND
Topeka?
Fargo?

Just a healthy reminder in case you all forgot ￼
 Lol Texas 
I stood outside for 16 seconds today and literally sweat dripped from my head
￼
HAHAHA holy hell me and Brian on dat same wavelength 
❤️
♍️
My gut reaction is always prayer but I spose high 5 works 
Very valid question
￼
😘
Ok team, I need sexy girl names for my car. Currently top choices are Carmen and Misty, but I'm open to other ideas 
I'm not into you
More choices: Penny, Piper
Misty is fun but a tad too strippery. I like a little strippery though. 
Hahahahaha thank you Brian 
...
Hahahaha
I like Penny/Piper or Carmen 
Plz halp jo Amy beta
Hahahahaha
HEOKirsteBronwyn
Looool
SHE HAS BEEN CHRISTENED
She shall be Penelope. But she will go by Penny. 
She hates you 
Sorry brah 
LOL trey that's absolutely horrific
Hahahahahaha
🙈
Oh dear god 
What on earth is a masturdate
Lol
Never heard it before
Davis i agree with your sentiment regarding joanna’s spelling
⚓️
hahahahaha just read these. i love you guys
He's a fake 
🚡
^hahahaha 
Wait Amy you didn't send the Orange as a reference to OITNB? 
Not random enough 
Stfu
Guys. Studying for new psych/soc section on the MCAT. Holy hell I've never hated psychology more. This is straight up bologna. I've never been so insulted by your calling me a psych major 
It's literally just a bunch of God dang vocabulary. It's random hoes through history coming up with "theories" and "models" that we've all proven wrong, yet we still have to learn them 
It's sooooo worthless my goodness
This is the unrealest stuff I've ever studied 
It's just fancy vocabulary for stuff people already know 
And then goobers coming up with overly simple theories, everyone proving him wrong, then saying "it's too complex to model." Wtf 
Davis split mine
I just respond to where I get the message
Every ounce of hatred in my body is currently directed to you guys 
Wtf is wrong with you people 
LOL
noon yet
or else natalie will eat you
brian seriously wtf are you doing
oh ok, same
Hahaha amazing. So curious to see who this incoherent baboon trolling you is
Why
I had one of the worst days of all time yesterday
Literally could not imagine it being much worse than it currently is. Being destroyed from all angles 
I'm so baffled
I did something wrong
What happened? I'm having the worst summer of my life and yall are just partying and making money
Oh my god don't get me started
Synopsis of my morning/afternoon: innocently go to turn to computer on. It won't. Okay, we'll open it up to see what's wrong. Hm don't see anything. Must be the power supply. Let's take that out. Hmm we'll have to drill new holes into the frame. Okay let's go find a drill. Okay. Let's pull this out. Oh wait it's attached to something else. I guess we're taking everything out. Wow this is a mess. We just took apart the entire computer. Hey don't we have an old computer? *brilliant idea* instead of replacing power supply let's take out the hard drive from this one and put it in that one. Okay. Open up next computer. Load it in. Hours later, miraculously works. Now video camera setup doesn't work. Fixing video camera. Fixing sound. Fixing recording system. But day evaporating. Then go to other building to teach new kids how to review EEGs with those computers. Then come back to take care of mice and do an inventory (painful). Go write something up. Forgot something with mice. Back down to mice. Notes. Leave in despair. 
After all his this ends, I attempt to finally eat lunch at 4:30pm. 5 minutes in, Jeff calls. Casually tells me to add mini-presentations of 7 papers to my presentation that is already 100 slides long. Then tells me we should restructure the whole thing. Okay. 
SEVEN
This is also one of the hardest weeks of MCAT studying because we're supposed to start reviewing ALL of chemistry. Ie 2 gen chem semesters and 2 orgo semesters in one week
So, I end up doing Jeff's crap until 2am before I can even start MCAT studying, but even then we can't start chemistry because the AAMC was like "oh we forgot you also need to know these extra 100 terms/concepts for the soc/psych section"
So we work on those until we are physically falling apart 
Egregiously behind at this point
And on top of that neuro lab work is a nightmare right now. Reviewing these EEGs is an absolute nightmare because I have to retroactively organize 3 different people's crappy jobs and analyze it all myself 
AND I somehow have to learn the entire protocol for four ing neurons which requires sophisticated software and techniques, and of course a lot of time 
AND I had to design a drug study for these mice experiments that I'm SOMEHOW supposed to work on on top of neuron counting and EEG review 
of course this is on top of Jeff slaying me every afternoon 
AND trying to stay in touch with multiple different potential Fulbright mentors because I have to finish my application this summer WHILE I'm doing the rest of this 
On 3 hours of sleep on a night the past few days, not eating well at all, never get to really go outside or exercise
Have to wear jeans in 102 degree weather and walk between buildings all day
Anddddd fasting starts Thursday so I'll have no food for a month on top of all this 
Okay there's more but I'm done for now. Sorry that was a lot
:(
Get home from work between 5-7
Get to Duke at 7:30-8
Yeah. Hopefully we can wrap this up soon because I physically cannot keep doing this
Yeah we'll see... 
💜 sorry for exploding on yall just frustrated
He's just like "you need to do this now while it's fresh in your head before you get closer to your MCAT and other applications. You'll have time to study for it later if you finish this now" .............wtf
"Just trust me on this one. You probably don't think this is the most important thing right now but just really believe me on this one"
It'll all be helpful for me eventually. He's helped me a lot, if I can get all these papers done that'll be really good for me
I really shouldn't complain, I've got a lot of cool opportunities. Sorry again team
😘 
Joanna what's your job? Like what do you find out for people? I don't know enough about y'all's lives :(
Jo that sounds awesome! Culture is key
♨️
I appreciate culture, not garbage strewn across the floor
Sadly I am not watching the game. I can't
I'm already on track for 0 hours if I actually did all the work I should do tonight
I'll try and watch the last couple minutes if it's close
This is by far the least I've ever watched the Finals, as far back as my basketball memory goes. So sad
Enjoy for me bruh
hahahaha
#thedream
Omg guys I came into work early and finished early so I'm finally about to watch game of thrones. I'm so excited
has everyone in the group text that wants to see GoT seen GoT?
this show blows
￼in other news, ❤️ 
eesh that was a close one
Ohhhh baby
Haha yeah! Surprisingly easy fast today. I was just thirsty in the morning but once I made it through that it was chill. I ate dinner at 2am and breakfast at 3:50am so I had a lot of food before the day started I suppose, guessing that's what did it 
Ate dinner in the med school library, Leif brought me a 4 hour old sandwhich from firehouse so no feast but it was very satisfying. Water is delicious by the way 
Oh dear
For SB?
Nah lets just talk about SB 
real talk any ideas for fall break? Why you ask Dave?
Looool

lol slayed 
Brutal self-slay
Yeah, appreciate the honesty and that’s totally fine
buy them out
Yall ever think about how someone out there in the world has to have THE worst life? Like objectively out there, someone is having the worst possible human experience, and being literally anyone else would be an improvement 
Quite
😘
No no, at SOME level somebody has to have it a tiny bit worse. Maybe not immediately quantifiable but inequalities have to exist 
Also true I hadn't thought of that. Thank you for your insight Davis
Not with that attitude you won't

And roughly hundo-p of these are between the hours of 10pm and 4am
Guys........
Jeff just took it to a whole new level. 
We submitted that paper for publication and now have reviewers' comments to respond to. They gave us a timeline of 4 weeks but the next 4 weeks are the end of my Neuro program and I just got a whole independent project I'm just now starting. Journal said they would "be happy to give an extension" if we wanted it. So I responded:￼
He responds... ￼
He literally told me to quit my job
What the flying hell
Does he think I'm sleeping 2 hours a night because it's fun? 
SURE I'll just "start sleeping 8 hours a night." AND do all this work for you
"If neuro takes a back seat that's fine"...... NO that is literally my job
I don't even know how to respond 
Most astounding word: "ALL" your efforts. Like just drop everything else and do this instead. 
Enough to keep me very busy for a very long time 
ie a lot of work
I don't know, but I'd even much rather work on it while I'm just studying for MCAT than right now with research + mcat. It's just impossible 
😳
20% with no issue sharing? Seems legit

Lol

Sahhhhry baby

Every morning of elementary school, as I got out of the car I would say the entire "see ya later alligator, after a while crocodile" to my mom
oh my god

"AN" GAME?!

also this article is long af but an interesting read; would be interested to hear y’all’s thoughts on it http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-death-treatment
interesting to compare to this, which i just happened to read next http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/26/opinion/my-periodic-table.html?smid=fb-nytimes&smtyp=cur
also i’ll just g f myself now since none of y’all care
Thanks girls ❤️ figured you would be more responsive 
Davis -- I agree. Generally my ideas on this are not as well formed as I would like them to be. But I could support it in certain circumstances; there's just such a gradient though and I think these Belgians are taking it a bit too far with the leniency and frequency 
Interesting bits: "In the past five years, the number of euthanasia and assisted-suicide deaths in the Netherlands has doubled, and in Belgium it has increased by more than a hundred and fifty per cent. Although most of the Belgian patients had cancer, people have also been euthanized because they had autism, anorexia, borderline personality disorder, chronic-fatigue syndrome, partial paralysis, blindness coupled with deafness, and manic depression. In 2013, Wim Distelmans euthanized a forty-four-year-old transgender man, Nathan Verhelst, because Verhelst was devastated by the failure of his sex-change surgeries; he said that he felt like a monster when he looked in the mirror. “Farewell, everybody,” Verhelst said from his hospital bed, seconds before receiving a lethal injection."
THIS is crazy to me: "In Flanders, where the dominant language is Dutch, euthanasia accounts for nearly five per cent of all deaths."
^wtfffffffff???
And they start teaching kids about the ethics of euthanasia in the second grade 
Anyway I'm in bed now but shall discuss this tomorrow 
❤️ davey
Nat -- I agree spending exorbitant amounts of money in the last few weeks of life can be needless. I would support it in that sort of case where it's a certain terminal illness and you're at the end with nothing but pain left. But for the examples in my first quote -- that's just not the case, and I'm less okay with it. But yeah we can chat in person 
Also guys I just slept for 13 hours and it feels god dang glorious 
Thinking about going back to sleep
Of course I can see psychological illnesses being crippling, and I agree euthanasia can be warranted in those cases. Brian and Nat, when you say you're more okay with it than "most people" does that mean Americans or the Dutch/Belgians or who? Because I would bet these Dutch/Belgian people are on average more okay with it than even you are. The logistics of it all are insane -- some stat in there said that half of all euthanasia cases aren't even reported to the official board that regulates it, some patients are given some really shoddy opinions by people that are very pro-euthanasia, teaching in 2nd grade, etc. The whole culture seems to present the choice far earlier than I would; society teaches them how okay it is so early on, that when people get sick they see it as an option *before* exhausting all medical ones. And the physicians seem to be okay with that too. Just interesting 
Davis, plz learn what Scandinavia is
^^^^^yes
Indeed
Correction: it's not 50% of deaths, it's 5%. But that's still insane -- like one out of every 20 kids in your class gets euthanized? Hefty
But yeah I would agree that those secular humanist groups are absolutely advocating FOR it, which is the problem like Davis said
I think it's very different from abortion, but that's a separate topic
My line is: don't present it as an attractive option 
Present it as a final resolution to put people out of incurable misery 
Haha kinda true Davis, interesting  
All you hoes￼
😳
Saw that. Thought of us. 
😩
Wow
………
absolutely. detest.

CREW POLL
when i say “a lot of people (read: men) are bufoons”
how do you pronounce “read”
do you say 1) “read” as in “I like to read books”
2) “i read that book a long time ago”
davis that does not answer the question
but that does, thank you
THANK YOU 
Lefko is vehemently defending that its #2 
like wtf
thank you for realizing that brian hahahha
classic
that was the crux of the question, so no it was not implied
but i understand
😎
was “mine” implied as “mind” too?
is that; what you meant to say?
hahahahaha
i’m sorry i’m just having fun
i understand i understand

hey, at least you just sent a text with more than one clause in it
indeed, but entirely negated by your paltry delivery
lol furreal
later on in the bio… “he also created the statistical concept of correlation and widely promoted regression toward the mean.”
wtf, he came up with the idea of “correlation”? are you joking?
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Could've barked yourself
^^^^^
Lol
i don’t know if i’ve told y’all this before but the neurosurgeon i’m working with, did his residency at stanford, total baller — started college at age 13 at UCLA. blows my mind ￼
nutty
i really want to know what he was like as a kid. also what 5 years of education he just casually skipped by age 13
^hundo p
and to top it off, at med school he met his wife, and they couples-matched to stanford for neurosurgery and ophthamology, 2 of the most competitive specialties there are……….. wut
and now both professors at duke lol
just wild
very
makes me lol at every meeting
yeah precisely
…
lol
Also, don’t know if y’all follow humans of new york or not, but this is pretty insane — his most recent posts are about this rural place in pakistan that essentially enslaves families to make bricks. In 2 days, he’s raised over $600,000 to help end it, $400,000 in the last 6 hours. If you’re going to donate to anything this year this might be a good thing (goal = $1m), if nothing else, the stories are a wild reality check — https://www.facebook.com/humansofnewyork?fref=nf

pollen comment was nice
guys i was such an idiot today. in class professor asked some hypothetical question about “how much would you bid to have lunch with bill gates at duke” to which i, out loud, responded $2. Little did i realized there was a parenthetical part of the question that said “all money will go to charity.” so everyone else yelled out numbers between 50-100…. and everyone just stared at me… 
didn’t realize it til like 30 seconds later
now everyone thinks i’m a douchebag
huge self-slay
could do
Lol

Joanna straight up ruffled all the jimmies
Most alpha thing she's ever done 
I slayed myself. Thank you moose
Hundo p deserved 
Hahahahaha
It's funny because it was literally 2 minutes. This is awesome. And I doubt "barre" started at 5:23pm
Maybe she meant do talk want "dinner" as in "not dinner"
Yall*
"Joanna" still has not clarified 
Rofl
Yes Joanna, they responded at 5:25
This is over 
LOL Nat hates Happy China 
The one time we went you didn't like it! I very distinctly ember 
remember*
"this has all been a huge miscommunication"
You said the FOOD was not good, Dilski remembers. 
Anywho
Yall enjoy 👌🏼
Wtf you were not there Brian
No sorry :( as much as I'd like to watch you enjoy happy china for the first time 
PSA: their fried chicken is awesome. Don't pass up. Also the classic general tso's chicken is great
Tingle, check out this Durham Yak ￼
I'll up it for you 
😘
￼
;)
I have a box of ground beef made in the fridge 
THANK YOU NAT
Not quite sure what that is... It's just how my mom makes it. No taco seasoning. 
Guys I just had a nightmare that I was accumulating emails and an irresponsible rate. Like 70/hr
Scared so much I woke up
Bruh it has plenty of other seasoning 
Brown people make ground beef without taco seasoning but put other spices in it
Sorry didn't know I had to delineate recipe for every time I mentioned food in fridge 
Jesus I just wanted taco shells 
Holy hell. 
I'm out before this gets out of hand 
I think I'm being trolled 
THANK YOU DAVIS
Davis is 1000% correct here. I love 
I loooooove you Davis 
I'm not just going to straight cook something with NO spices in it whatsoever. I will make it how I want it. However I needed shells. So I asked for them. 
Holy shit Davis definitively gave us the best answer, he said I interpreted his question correctly and that's what I was arguing about. Idgaf
*decided*
Only people in conversation. 
We always did decided with 2-1 with 4 boys 
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Davis I somehow agree with everything you're saying. Idgaf even if you were trolling I'm happy you're putting words to my thoughts 
Hahahahahahahah
Omg dying 
Except Davis 
Odd, in a 3 person conversation Brian is the only one who missed out 
Why wouldn't you just say "seasoning"
Clearly it was going to be out in tacos. 
Put*
HAHAHAHAHA
Omg Davis you're the greatest 
Hahahahahahaha
I'm still baffled -- you thought I just had like, pure unaltered beef cooked and was going to put that in taco shells? Why would you assume that I would think to put NOTHING that I wanted in it?
Thank you again Davis
I know that you have to put stuff in the food. 
ALSO it's my mom's cooking. But that is now besides the point 
Lol Brian so far behind he's giving himself W's with his back against the wall
At the end of regulation, the score is 2-1. *decided*
Hahahahaha
ALSO quote Brian: "I ****assume**** it's made sans taco seasoning"
And I clarified immediately after you asked a ludicrous question, bb
Too late? 2 texts later?
Without any second questions from you?
Yeah I'll say something at 9:30
Sorry - "I will wake up Mehul with a loud voice at 9:30" - in case that wasn't clear. I know you don't like thinking for yourself
So you admit I answered your question appropriately without further questioning 
lol the fake solo smack down, classic Brian move. Clearly others disagree but he nonetheless continues rambling
Is that how you "win" in wrestling too?
Self-declared winner? Just raise your own hand after the match? Wouldn't be surprised 
"He assumed he won because the ref and the scoreboard say so, but he doesn't know"
Nope nope, scoreboard pretty decisively projecting 1-2 right now. Ref just there for analogy. 
You're like the slow kid that all the teachers have to say "good job" to to keep his morale up. 
But everyone else knows the truth
In this group, beauty is in the eye of the *decided*
Unless definitively proven otherwise by the source of the disagreement, as the case last time
Lol. 
TD'd all over your mom's eye ;)
Oh she makes them great, I nailed TD into her taco
😳
Such an odd time to switch 
Brian do you agree? 
Let's team up on Davis for being weird 
Lol
Knew that was going to be your response. But always fun to have predictions about your jerk friends acting like jerks 
Plz do
Brian you don't even have the guts to tell one of your girls you're not into her. That's the definition of beta
😳😳😳😳😳😳
You said "i never want this to be more than sex" and she said "okay let's have lunch tomorrow"???
Hahahahahaha
You ring-shopping bro?
Nothing is more important than "taco seasoning". If she gets that, wife her up
True, he did 
If you were truly flying solo, wouldn't be a problem telling mo you slammed a UNC girl
^^^davis on point 
🙌🏼
Also we're about to receive twenty "tdoc" snaps in a row from Tingle
The best
Just finished the series yesterday 😭😭😭

Who's tryna get a flu shot with me today on east at 6?
Amy you're a goof 
Can't be friends with you CLOWNS who don't believe in vaccines. That's worse than not believing in climate change 
SUUUUREEEE
I'm not having this conversation 
20 minutes? Try 10 seconds 
Even then, that's boohockus. Davis would wait longer for a squat rack 
I am now removing myself from this conversation 
Absolutely
Absolutely 
Idgaf 
Ok stfu
I'm out
You can't suck me in
I can't be trolled
I thought I told yall I have hospice volunteer training all weekend? Sorry maybe I just told boys
Also which 3 of you are coming to Lemurpalooza Saturday at 5? Brian Amy and Davis?
Davey you still in? It's only a few hours Tingle don't sweat it!
Hm who said they would be the 3rd... Mehul? 
good question, i vote yes
also i’m legit confused, i know 3 people said yes for lemurpalooza. Davis did you initially say yes?
gotcha. so i’m confused. did Nat say she would go?
okay so it was Jo
even though you knew it was your bday weekend? agh 🙈
😳 i could’ve sworn i said i wanted to fill my car of 5, said i had 3 spots, and then got 3 yes’s. maybe i’m delusional
i’m just genuinely confused
And Tim Duncan went to the Spurs
Don't make me investigate
Going for flu shot on east if anyone wants to join

Your mom said TD was delicious
Your mom paid me to give her DN
🙈
Legit question: how could copying someone's code be construed as okay? Isn't that effectively turning in the exact same thing as someone else?
Yeah I'm asking how people think that's okay
Ah. That doesn't seem to be Jo's problem though Davis 
Right like I'm trying to make an analogy to a chem lab or something, discussing principles but not details 
Eesh 
Anyone driving home soon?
Or nah
Ubering now if anyone wants to join
That's awesome. Name?
Lol

bruh Duke started that 3rd year program — first in the country
also lefko is not in this group
lots of other schools around the country have already copied that Duke 3rd year model — certainly not a new idea, Duke started it several years ago. but yes it’s a good idea
Word. but yeah the 3rd year of freedom is awesome. i’m so excited for years 2-4 of med school haha
Woah Amy that's crazy. Good to hear

^exsctly
Mehul being a fool
May-fool
Davis just didn't know a hurricane existed 
*decided*
And he had no idea a hurricane was in the discussion anywhere
Absolutely not 
"I had no clue [there was a hurricane]." -- Davis. <-- making fun of him for this 
One of the easiest *decided*s in a while
Bruh you already called yourself an idiot, can't be saved 
no
lol
Lefko said it took him 3 hours to purge his Facebook 
Most of it he said

Lol@donald
Natalie, you said there was no way he became the nominee... When does he stop leading the polls? 
Eeeeesh Carson? Boo. Who do you think is actually going to get it?
It's true that the shenanigans from these guys have gone on longer than expected right?
Lol@imagining natalie taking a stool sample

Hahahaha omg rooting for Trump so hard now
I think he meant Jeb 🙈
Maybe not who knows
Meh whatever I'm out enough for dilski 
🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈
Joanna I don't think Davis was ACTUALLY saying GB should be president logistically. He was making a theoretical point. He wouldn't seriously advocate for a 3rd term
It's implied by the fact that Davis isn't a goon
But YOLOOOO who's pumped for escape the room???
Ah politics. Anyone want to talk about religion and money too?
￼
￼

Also water is wet

 I love it when people say they have to do that. I'm so excited to see the new version of this. The pity that the government has been in the world 
I don't know what to do with the new update to fix the bugs. You know how much I love you so much fun to play with. The only thing that I don't have to be able to do with it is the most important thing in my head and the other day I don't think that I can see it as an independent counsel for all the time 
Andre hahaha who's that TANGLE
vom
both
^plz get me that for secret santa
I'm going in 2 min
Jo I don't know what that means but I'm happy for you!!!
good q
Hahah that wasn't some kind of inside joke?
Goooooooooo Jo that's awesome
amy if you want to get lunch around 1:20 on west i could do that. if you want to climb out of gardens that is
meaning i can’t go to the gardens for lunch because too much transit time, so if you want to come to closer to buildings on west that’d be nice. perhaps outside old chem
i got me a free lunch from lab meeting, so i can meet you once you grab something!
woot woot huzzah
Save Chinese food for me plzzzzzzzzzzz
😑
Mehul no, Brian asleep, I'm about to get in shower 
I feel dat Jo. What we wanna do? Cruise? 😳

Yar just don't want to intrude with a whole posse
Oooo okay

Power to the moms
Belize or Alaska sound dope
Jo it's not THAT cold....

Jesus Christ it's supposed to be beautiful 
You sacks
So you're saying.... Y'all are in for Alaska. Perfect. Mama Treybig plz book
^correct
I want to do interesting things jafeel
"Why don't we just take the scenery of Alaska, and push it south@
Wait girls, you actually just want to sit on a beach for a week? I'm down for somewhere warm but preferably somewhere warm where there are also things to do besides beaches
Just trying to understand your ideal location
Ok that's exactly what we were saying to... Of course I recognize there are fun things to do in warm places. That's all we wanted, just saying we didn't want to beach all week. So we're on the same page
Too****
Davey want to ask your mom to find warm adventurous cruises that are relatively cheap (i.e. Not flying to Australia)?
(Although AUS sounds awesome)
Omg yes you too 
Holy moly
👍🏼👍🏼
I'm leaving at 5
I've never seen Brian use an exclamation point like that
