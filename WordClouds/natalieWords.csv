"Good gracious. Really regretting looking up what that is..."
"There's two definitions... This is talking about ""kicking someone in the private parts"" but that's not the first thing that came up haha"
"Yeah that's what I said! Mine is"
"What the heck Amy you're gorgeous"
"Awwwww!!! Tell her hi for me!"
"Yeah and now they're pulling the movie... So stupid. Like we were not going to get nuked because of a movie"
"And if we did then we'd have the excuse finally to multilaterally attack nk"
"Yeah it just came out today. Before we just new it was a North Korean group"
"Lol yes"
"In a society that controlled hackers aren't acting without government direction"
"Oh sure but they probably wouldn't have the ability or resources"
"Ok wait where are you getting that stuff about NK... Because I think what they say about their education system may not be entirely valid ha. Also just in general there is no way a government like that could survive if they allowed people the freedom to develop those skills independently of the government. Like NK simply cannot allow hackers to exist as independent actors "
"... Hi guys"
"Yall suck"
"I wasn't talking about the Daniel Wellington I was talking about the other one!!!"
"Davis and I discussed this. He thought the other one looked cheap too!"
"Adil thinks he can wear the Wellington one with sweatpants because it's so versatile"
"I just don't think he can make that band work"
"But he's welcome to prove me wrong"
"I don't know watch brands I was just trying to find something similar to what I liked and fossil was the only brand I knew!!"
"Yeah whatever haha"
"DAVIS THATS AWESOME CONGRATS"
"Guys colberts last episode everyone tune in!!!!!"
"Davis what'd you think about the word?"
"I usually love it... Not as big of a fan tonight. But yeah that was funny"
"Yeah was just about to text you... Like what"
"Don't think so?"
"Guys what is happening"

"Guys just saw mipso... It was in Morganton which is where Jacob the mandolinist is from. Turns out it was a fundraiser for his little brothers nonprofit that he started in high school fighting women's cancer because their mom died when they were in high school. But it was so cool and they were so good!!"
"Yeah they were cutting up with the crowd a bunch since it's all their friends and hometown people and it was so great!"
"""At least we'll die together... This is the dream."" -Adil"
"That's awesome Brian!!!!!!"

"I'm in"
"If you think about it send me your top three options and I can go check them out in the next couple days"
"No but I could go over there for the day!"
"My brother and I are watching the interview now"
"is that off airbnb?"
"I think we should be looking for more like 30 a night with 8 of us"
"I think that should be doable"
"Me too. We can also check out more traditional rental agencies to see if they have anything"
^^^
"It's like reading sports illustrated vs the Artemis fowl series or some other fantasy thing. Like sure they're both reading and you could read a couple pages of the books at a time but let's be honest who actually does that"
"Also the fantasy series are cultish but in a very different way from sports..."
"So they're social but just different "
#nerdpower
"I will say a lot of fantasy sci fi stuff has gone mainstream lately and lost the negative stereotype"
"Please don't start this."
"Just don't do it."
"I would say it's fine to label them as nerdy but not to think nerdy is bad"
"Adil stop that is not a rational argument"
"If you're going to talk proportions and statistics and how people get them wrong and have false perceptions ""50% of players are legit nerds"" seems like not the way to go"
"I think reading hunger games or playing wow can mean you're a fantasy nerd but that a surprising amount of previously ""nerdy"" stuff has become super popular to the extent that it's losing it's negative connotation. Take comic con or Colbert obsessing with lord of the rings"
"*boys move to boys text*"
...
"How does this happen"
"You're crazy haha"
"Ok yall were going absolutely crazy"
"Us today: Ôøº"
"I'm in haha sounds delicious"
"Also think about dinners next year"
"Like several times a week... Alternating apts"
"Or we can split it up and cook in the two kitchens and bring it over"
"So much food"
"And it'll be so cost effective!"
"We should coordinate menus and plan the week out so we know what we'll be making. Even if people can't eat together they'll know what will be waiting for them in the fridge when they get back"
"üòä"
"Oo tell me!"
"Perfect! "
"Just tell us what you want and we can do it too haha but either way"
"But yeah I can see us doing taco nights, pizza nights, burger (veggie burger) nights"
"Davis I would never do that to you"
"Also Davis I would love grilled chicken and veggies most nights "
"Ah and we can buy tons of edamame!!!"
"Davis I would lose it"
"I'm offering you grilled chicken veggies edamame and honest fizz!!"
"What more do you want? Well do it!"

"do better Duke"
"I‚Äôm actually so upset"
"yeah my friend was supposed to go on hannity"
"also apparently it‚Äôs not actually cancelled"
"it‚Äôs from the chapel quad instead"
"Oh they completely dropped the ball at first. This is actually fairly smart from their perspective though. All of the titles and articles make it sound like it's cancelled (which gets the freaks off their backs) but still allows it to happrn"
"Still pathetic though. Like stand by what you say. Don't say it didn't create unity when people of all faiths (and no faiths) were supporting this and are furious at the reversal"
"Also how can they tell is to ""change the world"" and ""move duke forward"" and focus on making a difference instead of just trying to make money and then completely bow to donor pressure showing money wins afterall?? Sorry I'm obviously fairly worked up about this haha"
"Chocolate thing is at 11 yeah?"
"Related to the adhan specifically or just life ha"
"Guys I accidentally just wrote a 2012 word essay to my dad about the adhan thing ha"
"You should! Also just got interviewed lol"
"Look for me on a video on washington post lol"
"The alumni association sent out an email for durham grown and replies went back to us: ÔøºÔøº"
"Except that duke made it sound like it was cancelled entirely in the media through strategic titles and stuff haha so I think that was intended to calm down people who might have otherwise done something. Also I think the biggest problem with it really was that it was from the churvh and the tower in particular. Huge deal for some on the Christian Right "
"No that's totally true I was honestly a little nervous at the event today ha and it dud seem a little odd"
Awww!

"Guys we literally have a tent in here...Ôøº"
"Kville haha??"
"Yes I will tonight!! "

"I'm free other than dinner at 630!"
"Where is everyone?"
"Anyone hanging out tonight??"
"Are you in your room?"
"No I was talking to Brian"
"I'm literally doing it as we speak"
"I just said if they were a really horrible person then maybe! But otherwise of course not!!!!!!"
"Working on it"
"It messed up my phone so I‚Äôm restoring it now"
exactly!!
"no. that‚Äôs horrible"
"that makes killing desirable"
"Like something you would wish to do"
"No matter who it is I would never take pleasure in having ended a life"
"Eh I don‚Äôt know... still not something I would pay to do or want to do"
"I wouldn‚Äôt pay to do it"
"Like money is not a factor in this at all"
"But I would do it regardless of money"
"I don‚Äôt know this is a stupid thing ha new topic"
Ok
"Hello everyone I'm updated!"
"I ate dinner but I‚Äôm hungry again lol"

"Tell me it isn't true"
"I‚Äôm in the loop!"
"Check out my live tweeting üòâ lol"
"He had this beautiful inspiring section towards the end. On the whole it was good. Confident. Not pandering to GOP"
"Davis I'm in abp where are you??"
"Wait but Davis that's actually good..."

"I would love it for a couple weeks but after that..."
"I think this is hard because my path is going to be like 20 different 2 year jobs each one of which (I hope) will be very different and cool. so I don't think the analogy works as well"
"I can definitely see what Adil is saying--I wouldn't feel like I earned it the same way which I would hate--but assuming I have 40 years of post grad work, the point about having more of that time spent on helping more people by being a doctor is also true"
"Across from soc sci"
"Sorry soc psych "
"That‚Äôs kinda still on you to re-set your alarm‚Ä¶ but yes he sucks"
"I‚Äôm agreeing! I‚Äôm just saying Adil should have set his alarm too!"
Wooo!
"Yeah I feel like 2 weeks is plenty but always nice to give them the ""out"""
"Yall there now?"
"Me too"
"What?? Where?"
"Honestly though"

"Davis I see you haha"
"Penn at 1 anyone?"
"Guys my brother got his nomination to the academy!! You have to get one from a senator/congressman to be considered and only 4 kids get them from this guy! "
"Anyone white tenting?"
"Ok poll: did you play neopets when you were younger? Do you know what they are? If yes to either, when were they popular?"
"Would you say third grade or middle school?"
" Spoiler alert: Jo lost haha"
"Who am I tenting with lol"
"They're already in black tents! I have no one"
"630 dinner anyone?"
"Study break for food anyone? I'm running by the tower really fast"
"If anyone‚Äôs going to be up working for a while let me know‚Ä¶ because of the hibernation earlier I‚Äôve got a bunch to do haha"
"I know I‚Äôm sorry I had to go to rehearsal!"
"Hey yall I've got some kinda weird news. Basically Adil and I decided to break up. There was no fight or anything... We just started talking about it out of the blue and decided it was something we needed to do before making a long term commitment. But we're both good and promise it won't be weird  haha. Just wanted to give yall a heads up"
"Everyone come!!!"
"Where are you?? I'm driving from east and can take you anywhere!"
"What's everyone doing tonight?"
"Shocking haha"
"Anyone hanging out haha?"
"You‚Äôre kidding‚Ä¶ that sounds so interesting"
"Ôøº"
"Anyone heard from Davis? We're supposed to go to lunch but I think his phone is off ha"
"Ok well seeing as he's apparently otherwise engaged... Anyone want food haha?"
"Also lol at the guys legs just flailing at the end"
"Here's another just in case you want 2 hahaÔøº"
^^^
"To think that I left at half -__-"
"I know."
"I know what happened but couldn‚Äôt find a clip of the end"
^^^
"So a couple days in each??"
"Also are these just for next fall or are these prices for now/summer too..."

"Craven d common room!"
"Lol like wut was that"
"Guys go look at the moon it's so bright and beautiful!!"
"That makes me sad because it's true haha"
^^^
"I said either too"
"I honestly don't care haha"
Yeah!
"üòâ"
"No ha let‚Äôs just wait. You could offer to provide more ‚Äúbiographical information‚Äù or something so he knows who he‚Äôs dealing with. Or you could say you‚Äôre passing it off to your friend and I‚Äôll take over‚Ä¶ but I can‚Äôt just pretend to be a different group haha"
"The same things will come up haha"
"It could come up haha I‚Äôm not going to lie about this"
"Perfect haha nice!"
"What's the easiest way to transfer the money?"
"Lol thought about applying for at large... Realized there was no good reason to do it"
"Haha I mean I fully intend to go into politics but there's a difference between real politics and student bs pretending to be a real thing"
"Like let's not take ourselves so seriously plz"
"I mean that parts true in real life too haha if anythig it's worse "
"No I just don't want to get in fights with people I go to class with over nothing haha!"
How...
"No it's the exact same argument. It is an organization that takes itself too seriously and pretends its work is more important than it is. So they get into these huge ridiculous fights worthy of far bigger issues"
"It's not because it's not ""legit"" enough. It's because people actually hurt each other over something that's not worth it"
"How?? "
"But yes I'm sorry Davis that sucks :("
"Brian is there a day soon where you could splurge and eat bread? Let me know haha"
"And Amy and I are"
"No I just ordered loop so I wouldn't have to leave my room haha"
"Come to vondy!"
"A while"
"Some of us aren‚Äôt nocturnal"

"Don‚Äôt got time for that haha"
"Anyone want to get monuts for lunch tomorrow?"
"We could take keyur!"
"What about before that?"
"Ah makes more sense haha... But yeah I'll do that! I can pick it up and we can just eat in kville"
"Yes but that's too early haha"
"I want to hang out with ruth can we get lunch on Saturday or something?"
"üòäüòäüòä"
"I'm pumped "
"It's been around 915"
"Who's with keyur now?"
"Can you send me his number?"
"I'm about to go to monuts... Free til 3 "
"I knoww I'm sorry! I really needed some sleep haha ask Joanna "
"That's what I was going to ask!! "
"We can either eat there and bring you some or just take it all to go and meet you after class"
"Wait Amy I somehow just saw this I'm so sorry!!!!"
"I got excited when I saw it!"

...
"I don't like that"
"Good haha"
"""All three victims were shot in the head, sources said.""

Doesn't sound like a ""parking spat"" to me "
"I think often you can't predict this stuff. And even if he had been locked up before it wouldn't have necessarily prevented this. Crazier stuff has happened than murders over parking tickets. But the brutality suggests that there was far far more to this"
"Oh yeah I'm saying the parking thing is absolutely bs don't worry"
"But separately from that we don't/can't predict when people will do irrational things"
"And lots of sources. Usa today etc"
"But it's just a single line in all the articles. No real evidence or discussion of it which is extremely suspect"
"(Sorry last text) I'll be interested to see how the Christian community responds since the guy was atheist... I can see them calling it an antireligion thing and working themselves into it as the victims but that would require solidarity with Muslims so... Basically my question is just how bigoted are they ha"
"That was the polices initial explanation. It's possible. But given several other factors Id say it's extremely unlikely religion didn't at least play a role"

"I'm 99% sure I also discussed it with them before getting on the waitlist. It was a standard question when I was calling around"
"Just confirmed that we are next door!!"
"Meant to be :)))"
"No don‚Äôt worry we‚Äôll get their approval"

"I'll come say hi! I have to run to a meeting though"
"Where are yall?"
"I'm just confused... Like there's no way it's actually a racial thing right?... Right?? I honestly just can't imagine that's still something people would do..."
"The only thing I can think of is that it's an April fools thing screwing with people about the whole scandal thing. Like some sick sick twisted joke. "
"Like I absolutely know the fight isn't over but it's still so hard for me to believe that level of blatant racism is still persistent enough for someone to do that"
"Agree completely"
"Ok but that's such a cop out... Like .001% of people do a lot of things we hate but we still find them deeply problematic and try to combat them. The fact that this exists in such blatant forms in isolated incidents indicates that it probably is far more widespread in a lesser degree. That's the biggest problem for me"
"Like sure it wasn't everyone who threatened violence after the adhan announcement but tons and tons of people were calling in and even more were complaining to their friends etc. it goes in tiers. The fact that this happened, even though it was just one person or one group, on this campus still indicates a level of hate I would expect to be gone. Like it wasn't a white supremacist group where you just say yeah but they're crazy do whatever. It was someone here"
"I guess what I'm trying to say is just that there's this perception that we live in a post racial society where we have made so much progress and everything when really people are just quieter about their prejudices. Like it's not acceptable to have them anymore (which definitely is progress!) but people still have those biases inside. So when something like this happens it's shocking because we imagine that racism is a thing of the past when in reality I think it's far more present than we realize"
"So yes it bothers me a lot just because I want to imagine that something like this can't happen any more when clearly it can. Even when it's a minority of people who told these beliefs"
"But you're right I'm definitely not arguing that we haven't made incredible progress. And rationally I know it's such a small group of people. But it's still easy to be overwhelmed by those incidents like this and the adhan controversy just because they're depressing and shouldn't happen at all haha"

"wait davis you‚Äôre so liberal! And townes literally just left and I was about to text you back about it! actually to ask you to explain it haha"
"ok‚Ä¶ that doesn‚Äôt seem to make sense though. Like raising the price of one of their costs shouldn‚Äôt make their total cost rise by the same amount right?‚Ä¶"
"Yeah. It just seems like a political move to some extent. As though they‚Äôre saying ‚Äúfine raise our costs we‚Äôll raise yours‚Äù out of spite rather than actual logical necessity"
"what do you think about raising the min wage in general?"
"I would in general agree with you. Used to describe myself as anti-party. But over the last year I think I‚Äôve come to appreciate the necessary organizational role parties play. That said I think a 2 party system is still absurd"
"And yeah me neither I wish I understood it better"

"Haha yeah see I just don't understand that though"
"Wait like cauliflower in tacos?"
"That looks so good!!!"
"We're going to eat so well next year"
"lol wait what did you choose haha?? also interesting that rubio was high"
"I wish there was a way to just compare all of our answers"
"feel like that would be so fun"
"what do you think about them that was different?"
"I can see that. and education?"
"explain haha I‚Äôm curious!"
"I feel like I‚Äôm that way about a lot of stuff now"
"haha ok looking forward to it"
"I get that. What policies lead to that then?"
"Yeah I really don‚Äôt know what I think about it all. been interesting to hear my mom talk about stuff and dealing with private v public school teachers"
"I really regret not having a more diverse experience at school. I didn‚Äôt realize how limited my exposure was until I got older. At the same time I really value the education I got so‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know"
"haha attaway"
"Y‚Äôall seen this iran deal stuff??"

"Ok did you see me on those roller coasters"
"You should know better than most people how serious I am haha"
"Ok but there are less painful ways to die"
"Like that would kill me and I‚Äôd be in agony"
"No the agony part is the whole way down"
"And then I‚Äôd have a heart attack"
"I will wait at the bottom and cheer"

"Guys I just realized I'm going to be home for one full day between now and school haha"
"Wait actually that's inane Brian haha"
"Alright come on now"
"The teaching about it thing kinda freaks me out. Maybe it's necessary for something that's going to be as part of their life/culture as this? But still. In general though I'm probably more ok with it as a concept than yall... Comes down to a question of whether we have a right to die/suicide. It gets more interesting though when you think about logistics. Like insurance companies paying for suicide drugs but not paying for continued treatment. I kinda think this is ok because spending on needless/extreme medical care in the last few weeks of life has gotten way out of hand and I don't see the need to preserve life at all costs... Meh I'm doing a poor job of discussing this over text sorry but it's super interesting "
No?
"You‚Äôre assertive about what you want haha but not a bully"
"hahaha what did she say"
"ps read the articles I sent yu on Facebook they‚Äôre so funny"
"Oh there is definite bullyish behavior haha"
"Yeah I mean I would say even for the psychologically painful illnesses rather than the physically painful ones I'm generally ok with it though. Of course not in all situations but more than most pie ole "
*people
"Sorry haha redo: manic depression, borderline personality disorder, anorexia... I'm not opposed to euthanasia in those cases. I think illnesses can be psychologically or physically painful and both warrant the choice to end life prematurely"
"Granted theres a spectrum and treatment options with medicine/therapy should of course be the go-to solution. But just like with physcial illnesses, if psychological ones aren't responding to treatment the person should be able to make that choice"
"I don't think anyone is advocating for suicide haha... Like no one is saying we should encourage euthanasia "
"I guess so. I think it's just two separate debates... Like what should happen in theory vs what makes sense from a policy standpoint. Whereas ideally people could have the option and should, we have to then ask what rules or standards are going to allow for that and inherently be seen as pushing for it"
"Like the insurance company example from earlier. They'll stop paying for treatment at some point, and offering to pay for suicide drugs can be seen as encouraging people to do that. The question becomes whether or not they would've paid for more treatment if that wasn't an option "
"I could get on board with that"
"I think from an individual perspective I don't really have a problem with people deciding when they want to die--illness or pain or not. But I understand that doesn't work from a policy standpoint "
"Yep it's similar"
"It's also not unlike abortions... Like yes we allow them, but how much education can be done about them? Can clinics advertise? Can doctors present it as an option and in what context? Etc"
"Where is the line between simply allowing it and presenting it as an attractive option"
"Sure but I'm just saying in that one respect the debate is similar: allowing people to choose something that should happen only in worst case scenarios and not presenting it as an attractive option "
"Davis you love feet how do you not like pedicures"

"‚ÄúTransCanada, the company seeking to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline, has asked the White House to suspend a review of its project, a delay that would almost certainly put off a final decision until after the 2016 presidential election.
It‚Äôs not clear whether the administration will grant the request, but environmental activists see the move as a bid to dodge a near-certain rejection of the pipeline.
‚Äú"
"so def coming from the company not the president indicating they thought he was looking to approve it so you‚Äôre right too adil. I think I‚Äôm just more generally surprised that something happened on it after talking about it for years and years"
