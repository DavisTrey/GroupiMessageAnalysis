"Holy moly y'all "
"Oh my god I just got 150 messages from y'all from the last 24 hours at once "
"^ true"
"^ indeed "
"<3 Adil"
"It said holy moly y'all"
Ahhh
"Nah I didn't see any of that till this morning "
"Okay so"
"They told me to bring a blazer and that we would meet at Columbus circle "
"So I told my cousins this and they were like oh there's some nice restaurants around there that's awesome! There's this one called per se but there's no way y'all would go there, it's pretty crazy "
"So then I meet them at the Mandarin Oriental bar for drinks (which were $25 each...) before and i thought it was like going to be two or three of us... Turns out it's 6 cause they all flew in that afternoon to new York for dinner and then we're flying back"
"So then we start walking to dinner and they wouldn't tell me where we were going... Turns out it's per se"
"""As of February 2010, it is one of only seven restaurants in the United States to be awarded three stars in the Michelin Guide, along with New York restaurants Daniel, Le Bernardin, Jean-Georges, Masa, Chef Keller's California restaurant The French Laundry, Alinea in Chicago, and The Restaurant at Meadowood in St. Helena.[3] The restaurant currently has four stars, the highest rating, from the New York Times (awarded in 2004[4] by Frank Bruni and again in 2011[5] by Sam Sifton) It was named as the 9th- best restaurant in the world by Restaurant Magazine in 2007.[6] Restaurant ranked Per Se number 10 in the world in 2011.[7]"""
"Are y'all getting these? iPad keeps saying they're still sending "
"Okay so this is the menu Ôøº"
"Wait what all of what I sent has gone through?"
"Ok ok 1) BCG people from Dallas. The guy who recruited me who is a project leader, another duke grad project leader, and then three associates that I've become close with. They all flew in last night from around the country lol and then flew out this morning 2) it was truly unlike anything I've ever see before. There were as many servers as people in the room dining. Apparently you have to have reservations months in advance. It had the most incredible view of New York too 3) best item was the truffle risotto for sure "
"No no"
"Adil i was actually wrong last night "
"So the base prix fixe was $310"
"But with the additions each persons was $600-$700 "
"And then there were 6 or 7 bottles of wine "
"Which ranged from $600-$1000+ (they wouldn't say how much that one was)"
"So all in all I think it was around 8"
"I thought it was less last night Adil "
"Aged beef was very good. Same consistency as franklin brisket almost, you could cut it with a spoon haha "
"I don't think they do this very much if at all. They said that it was by far the nicest meal they've ever has "
Yeah
"Haha "
"No they can go beyond $50 for recruiting stuff and client dinners"
"I'm guessing strings though I don't know for sure "
"No definitely not worth it"
Agreed
"I really don't know to be honest. I didn't know how much they were at the time and I didn't really drink that much "
"They seemed to like it though haha and they were the ones ordering obviously "
"It's a good question for sure "
"Alright team, wanna hear your thoughts. Thinking about accepting my offee pretty soon and want to have y'all's blessing "
offer*
"Lol good talk y'all "
"Adil = true friend "
"I feel that dory. I'd get better selection for summer cases and all that if I accept early though "
"New FIFA >>>"

"Okay cool"
"Nope "

"Looking at potential places for spring break and this is one I found... What. Look at the views "
"Ôøº"
"Also is anyone for sure not coming?? This our chance for a full group trip"
"Isn't that insane dory?"
"Ôøº"
"This kitchen was made for you and nat"
"Are you in Boone??"
"Brian, the one I sent yall pictures of is $265 a night and can sleep 7, so like a little less than $40 per person per night. "
"I looked at a bunch of stuff too. There's places in the mountains, Wilmington, isle of palms, charleston, savannah, tybee island, Shenandoah national park, and as far north as Philly "
"Saved places in each if any sound interesting to y'all "
"Oh also a modern tree house in Asheville haha"
"Tybee is too Savannah as Isle of Palms is to Charleston "
"The tree house is pretty close to the mountains too "
"Check it "
"ÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøº"
8
"4 double beds "
"All 37 reviews are 5 stars haha"
"Me neither "
"I figure anything around $50 per person per night is reasonable so we got a lot of options "
"Also that house is like a 25 minute drive from the mountains/pisgah national forest "
"Downside would be that it's not literally in the first with the views like the other one above "
"Yeah I agree brian. The one above isn't that far from Boone though which has nice restaurants and all. But yeah would be cool to be able to go into savannah from tybee or charleston from isle of palms"
"Yeah "
"Yeah definitely have to check it out. I've heard of people our age booking that way though for sure "
"I feel like there's probably enough leads that someone will be okay with it through air bnb"
"Also 8?"
"Lol "
"Getting a gift for Cody there?"
"WHERES AMY"
"Haha you good"
"You're coming to spring break right?? And Jo too? "
"Ôøº"
"THANK GOD BRIAN"
"This Christmas I am thankful for Brian's voice of reason "
"Also Jo"
"Haha this is the gone girl argument all over again"
"""Any random yoloer"" hahahahaha"
"One of the phrases of the year, Davis"
"This argument is interesting cause it's similar to the gone girl argument (that Davis and Brian sorta agreed on) but now it's Davis vs. Brian "
"üòç Adil"
"No I agree with you dory don't get me wrong "
"But the argument for gone girl was that a movie is as good as you enjoy it "
"Which is pretty much Davis' argument for this "
"Also Adil can we have a Grand Budapest Hotel date when we get back?"
"Any movie, am I right?"
"Haha really?? Yesss "
"See you on January 8th for a Wes Anderson marathon in J101"
"All are invited "
"It's on the calendar "
"Brian I feel your argument "
"Completely agree that LMFAO as a band is shittier than their individual inexplicably successful songs "
"Truth "
"""When I'm gone"" by Mipso, specifically "
"0.333:0.333 (repeating, of course)"
Lol
"Davis you played WOW?"
"Ôøº"
"Ôøº"
"Brian right now "
" Also the other big difference is that people don't play Fifa one player nearly as much as they play two player "
"Like I would estimate the ratio to be 10:90"
"So two player Fifa you're spending time with other people (if not a big group) and socializing and happen to be playing a game that simulates a sport that we either play personally or at least know a lot about. WOW is an alternate reality "
"Yeah but Fifa is played socially with other people and wow is played by yourself on a computer screen "
"Dafuq "
"Why would I buy $400 in boxers?"
"Yall fools "
Wtf
"Me? Davis would be much more likely "
"What are yall talking about "
"Is this because I bought nice socks? "
"Y'all are weird"
"So weird"
"Now ima do it just for yall"
"Plz give son other examples of #thingsMegukDoes"

"Lol its going to be some Applebee's not just a random Durham restaurant "
"Aromatic flames are the most exciting "
"Yeah true true"
"Adil, I just found out on Wednesday that I'm gonna be creating/updating the playlists for a few Durham restaurants and now 113 Applebee's around the country haha "
"I'm not sure I understand the 100% Mehul thing  "
"But it's definitely exciting, if also a bit random that they asked me haha"
"Also is this the type of watch band that the girls were raging about? "
"Ôøº"
"Ôøºdat pig roast"
"Which restaurant?"
"You think we'd like it?"
"Play it!!!"
"If you need help on rules tell me!"
"You talking about things, Davis? "
"Or wits and wagers?"
"The card game. You guess how many hands you're going to win "
"With 3 total? You could start 13"
"Which games Davis? "
"Yes can we please play more judgement "

"Yeah so I'll be back at 730"
"But like if he could get like 6-730 then I could get dinner with my parents "
"Yeah it appears as though he is "

"Friday would work for me I think!  "
"Davis you at tech connect?"
"Also Adil is that 40% number drastically different at Duke?"
"Yeah that is truly crazy "
"Not to mention that statistic is skewed by the fact that many med school classes have a weed out mentality that keep kids from applying in the first place "
"So in reality I'm sure the number of kids who truly wanted to be doctors but then either didn't get in or were fundamentally discouraged from applying is closer to that 40%"
"Yeah but there's gotta be a solid chunk of those kids who were made to feel as though they couldn't get in and therefore dropped that goal"

"Real talk, team. When we trying to decide on location? I think it's between the blowing rock and banner elk ones

Blowing rock (https://airbnb.com/rooms/2291926?s=8)

-7 beds
-foosball table
-has hammock, tire swing, fire pit
-1 acre property, can hike to lake
-near outlet mall (lol)
-right off blue ridge parkway
-37 min from banner elk
-9 min from blowing rock
-24 min from Boone
-1hr 43min from Asheville
-$53 a person per night

Banner Elk (https://airbnb.com/rooms/2473479?s=8)

-3 bedrooms with king beds, one roll away bed
-Slightly nicer kitchen
-insane views (actually)
-closer to ski resorts
-6 min from banner elk
-40 min from blowing rock
-35 min from Boone
-1hr 42min from Asheville
-$51 a person per night "
"It's like 10 mins vs 30 mins, Adil"
"The view is bonkers "
"Yeah I think the big things are that there are less beds (we'd all have to share) but nicer house/view at banner elk vs. more space/stuff to do at the house at blowing rock "
"From what I can tell blowing rock and banner elk are really similar (each has around 1,000 people, 40 restaurants, similar looking downtowns etc.)"
"Yeah true but like in the first there are four full size (not twin) bunks and three other queen/kings"
"Everyone good with Monday-Saturday/Sunday for spring break??"
"Speak quickly if you have objections "
"There's a chance he can come after Wednesday"
"Guys we should confirm the following things today:

1) everyone good with leaving Monday?
2) would you rather come back Saturday or Sunday?
3) if you said Sunday, we would need to go to the blowing rock house. If you said Saturday, we could do either. Which would you prefer? "
"Please respond with your votes"
"Mine are:
1) yes
2) probably Sunday but open to either
3) blowing rock (mostly cause of Sunday answer above but I do wanna see that view though)"
"They've gotten multiple death threats"
"Apparently "
"They were offered police escorts for tomorrow "
"And alternate places to sleep tonight "
"Haha yeah he just told me that they were trying to get publicity and it ended up working out "
"F that adil"
"F the studying. Other stuff is great "
"Over spring break?? Absolutely not"
"Might update a NBA spreadsheet but no homework "
"Proud of you for that "
"Haha so the worst of both worlds..."
"What's the consensus?"
"Adil how many are in line now? "
"Till Saturday or Sunday, y'all? "
"Can someone answer my second question?"
"Much helpful "
"At all or for the second weekend? "
"how am I supposed to book it if we haven't decided on Saturday vs. Sunday yet? "
"No one responded to my question on that last night "
"Joanna I think the Monday part is confirmed so you're good on that for your flight "
"Seems like blowing rock is the consensus"
"But Saturday vs Sunday has to be decided "
"Everyone good with that?"
"Yeah I'm Sunday"
"Alright so we're good for Sunday then?"
Booked
"Well by booked I mean the request is in, the host has to accept it in 24 hours "
"The guy that I requested through just asked for the ""ages and composition of the group"" "
"Should I lie? Say we're grad students or something?"
"Haha that's really good, thanks Amy!!"
"He said ""Let me discuss with my wife and get back with you. We take extremely good care of our place and want our renters to do the same."" üòî"
"This guy kinda sounds like a dick"
"Plus it has a $500 security deposit"
"This guy sucks"
"He also owns the banner elk house FUUUUUCK"
"Davis can you send me your 4.0 resume? That should do the trick "
"We should start thinking of other options just in case "
"I mentioned the girl guy split and sent the message you sent, Davis "
"He responded ""my wife is on a flight now, I will get back to you in an hour or two"""
"Lol nat you should try the same guy haha"
"Wait for like a day haha that'd be so suspicious "
"Say 6 of us instead of 7 too"
"And say we're grad students lol"
True!
"Haha you totally could! Say some of us are grad students or something and he'd never know "
"Guys good news/bad news"
"Bad news: John from airbnb has now decided that my name is ""mogul"" and has referred to me as such multiple times "
"Good news: we got the reservation!! üòé"
"Don't forget mooshoo"
"Haha my last message said ""I completely understand that. I can promise you we would be extremely careful with the house, and would be happy to provide any other information about our group that you feel might verify that."" And then he responded ""Mogul,
In trusting you will respect our home. I have accepted your request. You can go ahead and book it. John"""
Lol
"Okay so for now, assuming that Brian can't come and Adil will be there for 4 days (if either of those change we will re-allocate funds), me, Davis, Nat, Amy and jo owe $335 and adil owes $223"
"Please pay me soon as my bank account is $2000 less right now lol"
"Well we'll assume he's gotta be in Durham until at least Wednesday. If he is able to come then he will just pay each of us the difference "
"Similarly if Adil can stay for more or less time then we will all either pay him or he will pay us"
"Power of spreadsheets "

"No he's not here Sunday "
"Are you off campus tonight?"
"Is everyone else in for tonight? Amy? Davis?"
"Perfect "
"At least Brian Adil me Nat Keyur Raina and some of her friends maybe "

"We could also do a house if we can't find apartments if Erwin goofs"
"Question for all: if you were to jump off a 15 foot ledge, what would be the ideal way to jump down to cause minimal injury to yourself? "

"Keyur had an absolute blast. Thanks for helping us get in Adil!!"
"Brian's wakes up from nap... ""Siri, what's 75x25?"" "
"Dudes dreaming about math"
"Duke scored 1.42 points per possession today against ND... The best offense in the NCAA scores 1.2 per possession"
"There was an extended stretch where duke was scoring more than 2 points per possession... As in they had 17 trips that resulted in 16 baskets and an offensive foul call because Jahlil dominated some fool named Boozy so badly that they gave him a pity call "
"One of the best sports statistics guys called today an ""extreme sporting event."" Hell yes"
"Lol yeah"
"They were so far under 1 today... "
"also Jahlil was not in for most of the 43-7 destruction hahaha"
"""When you go through one like that, I always go through the stat sheet to make sure it only counts as one loss,"" Notre Dame coach Mike Brey said."

"You could do some amazing stuff"
"You'd have a budget upwards of $10k to do dope branding stuff "
"You'd be so good at it too"
"Yeah I'm hoping to be EVP"
"OMG this could be amazing"
"Current guy kinda sucks"
"You'd be an infinite upgrade"
"Haha holy shit we could "
"Nat you could do VPE so well"
"Hahaha this would be truly magical "
"Haha Davis I thought that's what your thoughts on it, I was like damn Davis knows  "
"Yeah plus the direction we wanna take it in next year is that for a given event, the VPE would be in charge of setting up partnerships and pushing smaller related events with groups on campus with a vested interest in it. Like the Laverne Cox talk, partnering with BDU, women's center, etc to host talks and events related to that talk so it has much more reach/buildup/built-in marketing "
"If we can actually get VPE to that, that'd be incredible for DUU"
"Yeah the me too stuff was what I thought of immediately for your potential interest in this "
"Nah that was president, the rest are due on Friday"
"I assure you it's Friday haha"
"Pranava just won president, was the only candidate haha"

"I'll be voicing my support for you for sure "
"that's so so so messed up "
"Ôøº"
"This going to happen at our model un conference this weekend, nat?"
"Also Jahlil just said he's ""totally comfortable with the idea of staying in college"""
"Also this "
"Capel‚Äôs favorite Okafor moment didn‚Äôt occur during a game or a practice or even on National Signing Day. It was last September on the day Capel‚Äôs son turned 2.

‚ÄúWe had a workout earlier that day,‚Äù he recalled, ‚Äúand as we‚Äôre getting ready to leave Jah asks, ‚ÄòAre you having a birthday party? Is it OK if I come?‚Äô ‚Äù

That was more than nice enough, but it was a little thing the then-18-year-old Okafor did next that put Capel over the moon. He showed up with a gift. No, he didn‚Äôt blow off the party or, as many a player might, show up just to eat. He went to the mall, spent his own money and then played with the tiny Capel children for two hours."
"hink it‚Äôll be easy for this guy to leave this life behind after only one year?

‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt be. It‚Äôs such a great environment for him,‚Äù Chucky Okafor (dad) said. ‚ÄúHe enjoys being a student and enjoys the process of working toward his degree. He enjoys the university, the environment, the closeness to his brothers he plays with, his peers, classmates."
"‚ÄúI want him to stay on the path that he‚Äôs on, get his college degree, pursue all his goals,"" Chucky Okafor said. 

‚ÄúI know I‚Äôll be in position to live my dream in the NBA or live my dream and stay here at Duke with people who truly love me,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI totally feel comfortable with staying here in college, and my family wouldn‚Äôt care one bit as long as I‚Äôm happy. They know how much I love being here.

‚ÄúI love everything about Duke. I wish I could just stop time and be able to enjoy this as much as I can.‚Äù"
"üòç the boy loves duke. Makes me so happy that he loves it here"

Lol
"The first part of that isn't super true "
"Not like disproportionately so. They stopped having that as the main part of the selection process a few years ago and now it's about potential in leadership or something, not necessarily just in service. Also I think most people in the program definitely have a passion for/interest in service, but a lot of them are of the mindset that it's better to start elsewhere to make more of a difference later on. And I would say a significant portion have included service in their summers where they've had complete choice as to what to do "
Lol
"Yeesh yall when is it"
"I prolly could actually"
"But id be so bad at it"
"Also is that going to be yalls fourth or fifth class? Cause signing up will be hard if it's my fifth"

"That'd be so fucked up "
"Yeah I agree"
"Nat I would argue the opposite of your last point. The fact that it exists in blatant, isolated forms would indicate to me that it's actually less widespread, but maybe more deeply ingrained in the people that it is present in. Which I think Davis is addressing"
"And to go off that, I think that the work of people to eradicate bigotry is more in eliminating it from the masses (or even chunks of the population). Like there are some people (the 0.001%) who, no matter what anyone does, are likely going to have abject hatred in their minds for certain people. If those people are absolutely committed to being hateful and will be forever, does that mean we've made no progress at all in changing views on racism? "

The reason uber is cheaper is they don't have to pay the overhead that cab companies do for insurance, maintenance, city regulation, etc. The reason taxi drivers are furious is that uber is the same thing as a taxi but they just choose not to pay the fees that taxis have (and still have) to, and can therefor offer much cheaper rides "
